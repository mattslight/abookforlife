# A Book for Life

<p style="text-align: center" class="book-subtitle"><em>Some ideas we share.</em></p>

## Foreword

<span class="dropcap">M</span>ost books hope to add something to the world, perhaps the author has something she wishes to say. Maybe it's an inspiring story to tell, giving detailed accounts about characters and their relationships – describing in rich language places and the feelings they evoke. Other books are biographical, giving us detailed accounts of people's lives – often showing us the life behind the scenes of a celebrity. Novels can kindle emotions, take us on a journey of discovery or entertain us. Scientific books show us new theories, with ideas being rigorously tested. For it is of great importance to bring new discoveries to the world and to introduce methods for reproducing repeatable results. Religious and spiritual works have formed at crucial points in cultures and societies, giving us hope for the future or identifying a code by which we can choose to live our lives. Often contained in these works are moral teachings, being scrutinised by religious leaders and academics.

This book may fall short of lofty ambitions, it has but one simple goal. To lay out a collection of ideas that has helped many people turn their lives around. From battling addiction, to dealing with loss, grief, pain, inner personal conflict and turmoil. The ideas in this book have helped us back from the brink and to stay sane.

This book was written in lockdown at a time of a global pandemic, although there is little, if any, material here directly related to Covid-19. But just as we hope for the end of a global pandemic, and for our lives to return to normal, so then this book may be an echo of that desire for our lives to return to normal.

The point of this book is to humbly distill ideas, collected over the years by parents, sons and daughters trying to improve themselves and prepare the next generation of children in this crazy world. Ideas have been gathered and crystallised from a variety of sources, sometimes congruous and other times isolated pockets of thought with little apparent relation to the others. Do not be fooled, there is a purpose in sharing the set of idea as they are presented – even when they seem disjointed. We do not wish to reveal "an answer" as much as to highlight both sides of the coin – a good example of that is the duality of thought in _The Cost of Living_. Ideas are produced here with the simple goal of providing guidance and practical advice for living in a complex and rapidly changing world. In the most serious situations we have witnessed people save their lives by using a variety of thoughts in this book.

In one sense nothing new is presented in these pages – thoughts are borrowed from many different places, cultures and time-periods. Where we think the innovation lies is in bringing all the ideas into once resource. We have included writings to help with personal emotions, wellbeing and self-improvement and wherever possible included practical suggestions to assist in living a contented life. These ideas that have been discovered the hard way, through trial-and-error – and we had to find for ourselves what putting these ideas into practice really meant to us. Just as writing a recipe book will not compensate for years of practice in the kitchen, then the ideas in this book must be practiced to fully reap their benefits. Nevertheless this collection of thoughts feels like it should be something passed on – indeed all this wisdom, if it can be called that, has been shared to us freely – so if you find something useful please pass it on.

As younger adults we cared little for the ideas written on these pages, usually pursuing self-interests and believing that we knew best. At various points in time we thought we knew the answer to most things of practical value in life. Confidence and ignorance have ways of protecting our ego, like a sort of inflatable cushion. Our ego can take many hard knocks and you may be lucky enough that your protection is never punctured. But for the most part we found that sooner or later life has a way of handing us a firm reminder – that in certain situations our own resources are not sufficient – that we must rely on the help of others – and find a power much greater than ourselves.

So when you pick up this book and if you happen to find little value written on these pages – put it down then, keep it somewhere, tuck it away in a drawer or place it with other books on a shelf and hope that you never have to pick it up again. Go and live your life as you choose, become the master of your own destiny and see where you arrive.

On the other hand you may choose to consider this book an insurance policy, perhaps you already have everything figured out, but you feel that you might want to take note of a few ideas – "just incase". So then your view of this book is as a sort of life preserver, only to "break glass in case of emergency". You must then sincerely hope this emergency never happens to you, as you may find yourself in waters too deep. And what if this emergency could have been altogether prevented? Or better prepared for?

Whilst this book is not about the authors, it is entirely about the authors, giving us a sense of satisfaction and perhaps most importantly keeping us from finding less productive ways of otherwise entertaining ourselves. It is only through giving these ideas (or rather passing them on) that we get to keep them.

These ideas belong to no-one, certainly not to us, if by chance you find them useful share them freely. The thoughts have been handed from person to person, hopefully gaining wisdom and refinement through each passing of minds. Do not then let these ideas settle, lest they sit and fester – break them apart and improve on them whenever you can. It is the hope that ideas come from as many cultures past and present as possible, but it would be foolish to think that many stones have been left unturned. If you take this book onboard, you are encouraged to seek out as many new ideas from as many people as possible both dead and alive. Keeping in mind context, especially situation and historical, and that it is only ever the present moment that we have with us now.

Undoubtedly religion has had as much influence on these words as science. Before you dismiss any ideas out of hand, try to see where the message has come from and the context in which it was born. Decide for yourself what is useful to you and what is not. Listen to what people of religion have to say, see how you might use their spiritual messages to better understand yourself and the world around you. Take on board the learnings from science and engineering and build new ideas upon them. Trust in people who have more experience and wisdom than you, and do not take everything at face value. We hope you'll find threads of thought here from many walks of life – as many as could be assessed by the authors in a lifetime. The beauty of words passed through time is that the knowledge conveyed is greater than any individual could otherwise hope to discover in a single lifetime. If these ideas resonate with you and not with other people, then seek out ways of shaping these messages so that the concepts may be heard.

Challenge everything in this book and take nothing for granted. Do your best to respect all ideas from all people. Remember that the words written on this page or any other are from a snapshot in time, allow them to evolve and retain the sentiments – especially of love, tolerance, kindness and compassion. Speak with as many people as possible. Listen to them and hear their words. Look for similarities in your own experiences and set differences aside. Seek everywhere and you will find. Split wood and turn every stone to get to the core of an idea. Just as passionately as you look, know when to stop searching, turn your focus to the world around you or settle inwardly and go about living your life. Seek peace and serenity, and find calm in not knowing. The answer to a given question may come when you least expect. The question may need refining; Or the answer may simply not exist…

### A few words about this Book

The first parts of this book on truth and belief are awkward and perhaps do not fit with the rest of the ideas. We think that by reminding ourselves that the fundamental concepts of _'truth'_ and _'belief'_ can be challenged, then everything else on which they are built may also be. The chapter on _Action_ serves as a reminder to practice – not simly talk about all the ideas in this book.

_The Cost of Living_, the shortest chapter and at the outset seemingly disconnected from the rest of the writings is designed to highlight the futility of entirely materialistic pursuits. We live in an age where capitalism has dominated cultural development for a long time. For those of us who have escaped living in a capitalist orientated society the impacts of it will surely still be felt, whether through colonialism, trade, tourism or globalisation. Most of us have direct experience with business, commerce or promotion in one way or another. To disregard the cost of anything would be to ignore foundational roots in our global society. It is the goal then to bring forward these ideas and to show a duality in the way of thinking about the cost of living. There is a more subtle point here that is worth highlightning which is that any socio-economic arrangement is built upon the hearts and minds of people. It was once said that socialism is the perceived stepping stone to an ideal way of life and a required evolution of capitalism – but look at history and see how much influence greed and self-seeking have on these structures. Wouldn't lives that are free of greed, self-seeking and acting through fear be an improvement now? Before we influence the thoughts, aspirations and ideas of others can we not start with looking at ourselves?

Some foundations are laid in the two chapters on _Emotions_, with them ultimately leading into the core of the book on _Ego_ where we come to understand who we are, our limits and how we may escape them. The chapters on _Working with Others_ and _Taking Care of Yourself_, are designed to build on the concept of balance introduced in _Self Awareness_. Balance is essential for stability in anything we do. Just as an engineer builds a skyscraper starting with a stable platform, drilling concrete deep below the surface, we are more steady with greater inner personal balance – ideally that which roots itself down within the soul.

The later chapters _Practical daily life_ and _Dealing with…_ are designed as pragmatic guides, introducing concepts that perhaps are not taught at school or learned in other walks of life. It may be unwise to expect practical guides to answer every question you have, and perhaps you will find they are of little value or no personal application. In that case I encourage you to update the sections and pass these ideas on to be of greater help to more people in a wider variety of situations. It may not be possible to cover every situation. It may be more desirable to reduce the number of words in this book and to simplify the language to make it more accessible to more people. Feel free to remove or add parts of this book as you see fit but let your decision be guided by usefulness and practicality to yourself and to others rather than by ambition.

We would like these ideas to be as accessible to children as they are to adults, but we sense that children have little need for these words. These ideas are mainly formed by adults looking to make sense of the sea of thoughts formed in their heads over years of living. Children follow their intuition and probably have no need for a lot of what is written here. Watch young children play and see if they outcast any member or harbour long-term resentments. Don't they welcome each other with open arms and enthusiasm? Watch and you will see for yourself that children see past gender, social status, creed and culture. They play together freely, express their emotions quite clearly and wear their hearts on their sleeves. Learn as much as you can about yourself by observing carefully how children play, learn and communicate.

If you receive one message from this book let it be the idea to remain open-minded. Open your heart and clear your head, receive new ideas and remain forever optimistic in your outlook. Show everybody love and respect, especially to those who have made up their mind or seem set in their ways. Refer if necessary to the chapter '_Treating Others_' and remind yourself of what is important – expect to receive that which you give out. It will only be through giving that you receive. Accept the things you can not change, have the courage to change the things you can and seek the wisdom to know the difference.

> _What is the idea here to refer to that section?_ What has happened to the section on the Golden Rule - should it be included or not and how is this related to the section on Self-seeking? Where is greed / self-seeking talked about?

## 1. Truth, Belief and Open-mindedness

_When we make a decision or put our belief into something we close our minds off to the alternate possibilities. To believe the sun will always shine is to suppose that the opposite will never be true. Does a newborn anticipate the sudden darkness of night?_

### First, A point about Language

<div style="text-align: center" class="quote-title"><em>Take advantage of ambiguity – look at something and think 'what else could it be?'</em></div>

<span class="dropcap">W</span>hen we express ideas to others we have a variety of ways to do it. We can talk about it or write it down. We might draw diagrams or we can show somebody what we mean. A book is limited to words and the occasional diagram. Related ideas in the mind form a web of connections, but when we try to write these interconnections down we have to decide what to start and where to end – we are forced by the flow of chapters and pages to follow a linear narrative from start to finish. Words are also clumsy, just as folded arms could express a defensive outlook, so can the intricacies of language hide within them pre-conceived biases. As powerful as language is it isn't always possible for words to do thinga justice. So just as language can be precise and effective, it can also be ambiguous and blunt.

It is said that English has only one word for 'snow' – this isn't entirely accurate because we have the words sleet (wet falling snow), slush (partially melted snow), and so forth. On the other-hand Scandinavian languages, for example, have a far more expressive language to describe snow. This isn't because in Scandinavia there are more or different types of snow not found elsewhere – it is just because as a culture, survival and day-to-day living has had a greater reliance on being precise when talking about snow. A farmer might need to be exact about the depth of snow covering a field say – or how heavily the snow is falling – or the approximate compactness. Language is a human invention and it is up to us to decide how we apply it and what it means to us.

'Love' is great example of a word that means many things to many people in different situations. It covers: parental love, conditional and unconditional love, lust, joy, kinship, admiration, tenderness, passion, and more. If I ask "Do you love me?" - what should the answer be? Is it "Yes", "It depends" or "What do you mean by love?".

The same is true when writing about less complex things – consider a chair. Now a four-legged device for sitting on is a chair. What if it has three legs, is it still a chair or does it become a stool? What if it has no back to rest against? What if I add a restraining device such as a seat belt? Or what if it is made of jelly? Isn't it true that in the world there are continuous spectrum? And that by adding or changing one small element, we can create something else. Just as a light switch can be on or off, so can a temperature gauge be set to any point or any in-between. When it comes to language our frame of reference, our experiences, cultures, upbringing, context, what we've specifically done today, or how we are feeling at the present moment may alter our how we understand a word or an idea that is conveyed. Take time then to be as precise as you can in the things that you say and to take as much time as required to understand clearly thoughts that are being communicated. Ask questions if it is not clear. How many arguments or disagreements could have been avoided by both parties taking more time to understand what the other was hoping to communicate?

#### A note on ambiguities

Why should we care about ambiguities? Isn't it these very nuances of life that make it interesting? Can anything be absolutely static in life? In most situations we need not concern ourselves – in a conversation for example, when something is ambiguous we can ask for clarification, "what do you mean by that?". We can go one step further still and repeat back to the communicator "is this what you meant?". These two simple devices in two-way conversation help avoid confusion and ambiguity. Suppose however we write something down, and perhaps the author is no longer available to explain what she meant by those words – how then can we interpret or understand the meaning of what was written? We think of a few situations where ambiguity at its worst can lead to two completely conflicting views. Here are a few constructed examples:-

_"Marcy got the bath ready for her daughter wearing a pink swimsuit."_ – Who was wearing the pink swimsuit? Was it Marcy or the daughter?

_"I saw someone on the hill with a telescope."_ - Who had the telescope? Was I looking at somebody through a telescope or was the person I saw carrying one?

Furthermore, in language and particularly English – some words themselves have multiple conflicting meanings. "Fast", often used to express quick speed, can also mean to stop an activity altogether (especially in the context of food). "Buckle" means to tie down sometimes, or to collapse at others. "Screen" can mean both to display and to hide depending on context.

#### Lead By Example

So then language can be ineffective, sometimes the words written or spoken fall on deaf ears. Especially in our daily lives each of us has so much writing fighting for our attention, whether it be a book, words of promotion, those asking for help or selling us services. So then we have found that we can do much more than tell people – we can show people – when we show others the fruits of our lives from the things we put into practice – others too around us we find start to take notice. A change in our attitude gets recognition and people ask who is this new person with these fantastic ideals? We find that if we simply "talk-the-talk" we risk become hypocrites – people might see us as not practicing what we preach – and so then dismiss our ideas without ever taking them onboard.

By leading by example we help ourselves, we allow us the experience to put things into practice – for we have seen that even the best ideas on paper have fallen so often at the first hurdle when putting them into practice. Doing these things help us verify that they work for us, we see the benefit on our life and the lives of others – and so we intuitively learn the things that work for us.

A picture paints a thousand words. We can try our best to describe with words that which we want to explain – it is far more effective, we have found, to demonstrate through actions. Both for simple and more complex ideas we find putting them into practice is far more effective in getting our ideas across. And of course, the point is that if we truly want the benefits of these ideas to come about we have to put them into action – the fruits of our labour will only come about if we work for them.

So then we remind ourselves that sitting and talking is one thing, that may have some benefit by itself. Where we are confident our aims are to show love and compassion we put our ideas into practice, without delay – so long as we did not hurt ourselves or others in the process.

### Truth

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Determining the truth doesn't change the facts</em></div>

When it comes to truth – does such a thing exist? Great philosophers have covered ideas of what is true since the dawn of humanity. Many pages have been written and almost every angle considered. What then can be added from a short introduction in a book that is neither grounded in rigorous philosophy or academic study?

From a practical perspective we may experience at least three elements of truth. The first is that a truth can be verified or, we hope, proved by experiment. Suppose it is true that a length of a particular piece of string is 30cm, you can take a measurement and verify this. The second element to truth is consistency. If you repeat the measurement, upon taking the second and subsequent readings I should also see that the length is 30cm. If on the other-hand I take a later measurement of say 29cm I might not say it is true that the piece of string is 30cm long – at least not without further investigation.

The third element to truth, particularly in a social context, is universality. This applies especially if you wish to convey or convince somebody of a truth. In the case of the string you would ask somebody to also measure the length, if their measurement is also 30cm (or perhaps this friend trusts you enough to take your word about the piece of string) then you and your friend can both agree that the length of string is 30cm. For something in everyday life, like the length of a piece of string, testing these three elements and coming to agreement is relatively straightforward. So we have a good hope of establishing the length of string is 30cm and that it will continue to be so (unless changed). We can also be reasonably confident that others will agree and that we can then establish this as a known fact.

Now what about answering something more complex about this length of string? Let's say for example we would like to answer a question such as _''Is this piece of string strong?"_. In this case then what is the definition of strong and how do we agree on this? Which testing mechanism would we settle to use? We can take this allegory still one step further. _"Is this string good for use as a shoe lace?"_. For which type of shoe are we asking? And for how long should the string hold up for? Who is wearing the shoes and in what conditions? Are there alternative laces available? As you can see this answer in day-to-day usage of such questions may be considerably if not entirely subjective. Depending on how you look upon the question or your understanding of the situation you may say one thing. And depending on somebody else's point of view, they may say another. Is it that one of us is right and the other is wrong? Or is it simply that we are looking at things from different perspectives? When considering what is the 'truth' then, it is essential we keep an open mind – even to the prospect that a universal truth for a given question may never exist. We tended to find that honesty rather than the truth was paramount to conducting our actions.

### Belief

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>To believe with certainty we must begin with doubting</em></div>

When it comes to belief, things are equally quirky. Belief is partly about the truth, and it is also about one's own experience. Now we know that each one of us has had a variety of different experiences. Is it any wonder that this variety of personal experiences creates an equal or greater variety of personal beliefs? On top of this, one's personal beliefs have little effect on what '_is so_' and what '_is not so_' in this world. Does one's personal belief change what is? If I believe the sun is green - does it make it so? What if the way I perceive colours differs from the next person? Or my ability to see colours changes suddenly due to an eye infection? And what if I believe the world is a great place to grow up in and one day I believe it is no longer the case. Who has changed? Is it I or the world?

Let's say I believe in God – and yet there is none – does my belief in a higher power make a God exist? And what if my idea about a higher power is different from yours?

So then, in this world isn't it so that some things are, and some things are not? And does it matter what I believe to be true? The answer to a question may depend on who is asking it, where it is being asked, during which time, and so on. Science is the best tool we have for repeatedly being able to ask a specific question, in a specific situation and getting reliably predictable results. However just like a turkey, spending his life being cared for and fed by his farmer, would be unwise to assume this will continue forever – we so will do wise to remember that predictability only gets us so far. The turkey may well believe that this farmer is caring, loving and nurturing – only to one day have his neck chopped off. Just as the turkey would be mistaken to believe his captor is kind, would we not be wise to admit that what we hold true today may change? Perhaps things will change at a future point in time or when the cards are stacked differently or when new information comes to light...

### Open-mindedness

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>I never liked jazz music. One night when I saw a man playing the saxophone. I stood there for fifteen minutes, and he never opened his eyes.</em></div>

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>After that I liked jazz music.</em></div>

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Sometimes you have to watch somebody love something before you can love it yourself. It is as if they are showing you the way.</em></div>

In life we are presented with a great deal of choices, many day-to-day choices are small with relatively minor consequences, the choice of what jam to have on toast, what clothes to wear, whether to take the quickest route to our destination or the scenic route. From time to time you will be presented with options. To keep an open mind is akin to keeping your options open. Open-mindedness can be about saying "if I had to place my bets today, here is where I would put my money". Now just as any wise gambler knows there is no such thing as a sure bet – we would be wise to know that the odds may one day change – including today. Being openminded doesn't require you to give up your beliefs – for example, I am free to believe that God exists – but I still may like to keep an open mind. Let's say I meet a friend who holds a different opinion. And we decide to talk about the subject – now by sharing new ideas and being open to the other's point of view we may both enrich our position and gain something we would not if we did not listen to the other. Now that's not to say we have conceded our ideas – but aren't we more informed, especially about the other's view?

#### The danger of certainty

How can it be that confidence in something is dangerous? Surely being certain about an idea is a good thing, as it implies reliability. Certainty at its heart is firm conviction that something is the case. History is perhaps the best place to learn how certainty can be incredibly dangerous. Too often have we seen the actions of people being determined by ideas they held that could not be swayed. When I am certain about something I close my mind off to other possibilities – so in one sense certainty can be about being close-minded. There is perhaps nothing wrong with certainty in the moment, being confident that a choice or decision I take is for the right reason. But when certainty bulldozes the wellbeing of others at the expense of personal gain it moves into the realm of causing real and lasting damage, pain and suffering.

Lives have been lost through immovable convictions, wars have been started when two nations are certain their opposing actions were the only ones valid. When an individual or group's wellbeing is put above those of another, devastation is sure to follow – these are not pessimistic musings but are the evidence contained within the pages of history books.

So then in everything we do we strive to allow ourselves to be strong and yet movable, firm but willing to change and perhaps most importantly never convince ourselves with absolute certainty that our ideas are the only valid ones.

### Overcoming these hurdles

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>We don't see things as <strong>they</strong> are, we see them as <strong>we</strong> are.</em></div>

Bearing in mind the preceding sections – how does any book that admits these inherent weaknesses expect to deal with the shortcomings?

In order to get repeatable and verifiable results in anything we have to follow instructions, and understand context and application – science for example does this all the time. Lets say we go to our favourite restaurant and they bake the most delicious cherry pie. What makes this pie unique is the way the chef prepares the ingredients. The cherries come from the orchard connected to the owner's house, sun-ripened to produce the most delicately yet vibrant cherries. We have never tasted mass produced cherries that compare with this flavour. The mixture of the pastry is a secret recipe known only to the chef and has a precise mix of flour, eggs and butter – baked at precisely the right temperature in the restaurant's slow-baking wood-fire oven. So one day I decide that I want to bake this pie for my friends. The shop where I buy my fruit has mass produced cherries that taste 'good enough' – not like the ones I remember picking as a child. I buy frozen pre-made pastry to save me the preparation, and my oven at home is a fan assisted electric oven that cooks evenly and quickly. My friends come to see me but my pie doesn't have the same zing of my the pie from my favourite restaurant. My friends, impressed none-the-less, have not tasted or experienced the same delicately amazing cherry pie that I have.

So in order to get repeatable and verifiable results, situations should closely match the original as possible. Instructions (just like recipes) should be followed as closely as possible, in order that the results may be as authentic as those intended. We note that even the most detailed instructions can fall apart if not followed or applied in a different context. That said the ideas in this book have been tried by a great deal of people in a wide range of situations. Even practical guides given in this book are detailed generally and just as when engineering is applied practically from science, the reader may need to make minor adjustments of their own for optimal results.

Having cleared the hurdles on reproducing reliable results we arrive at the next stop – definitions. Suppose we want to avoid doubt or argument over a word we are better to come to an agreement before we start to talk about it, and certainly before we start to discuss different perspectives.

It is our hope that what we say is being communicated clearly and efficiently – but especially given all we have learned in this chapter we would be naïve to think that our expressions can be without interpretation. If the words in this book mean different things to you, but that the ideas could be useful, we encourage you to replace our language and substitute the words that better fit the ideas you wish to pass on. We have tried to use accessible language, kept jargon to a minimum and provide explanations or examples where ideas were at risk of being vague.

## 2. Take Action

<div style="text-align: center" class="quote-title"><em>Don't talk about vision. Show it.</em></div>

<span class="dropcap">T</span>o intellectualise the ideas in this book would be to stub them out. Just as a bird studied in a cage doesn't sing or doesn't fly – so then when these words are left on these pages they wither and die.

Be brave – we have learned that when our hearts and minds are set in the right direction so then our actions start from a place of goodness. In the past our hearts were aligned to self-seeking, looking at what we could take from the world. Our hearts had also been in a place of dishonesty, to ourselves and to others. We hid from our true natures and by doing this we felt shame in our actions.

We taught ourselves to align our hearts and our minds by combing them daily. The practices that we undertook particularly in _12 Steps for Life_ saw us achieve many things we thought impossible. We were able to live honest lives.

Firstly by tending to ourselves as a daily habit we could rake the soil of our souls and plant good seed. That is not to say that weeds did not grow but we were better off than simply having untended overgrowth – emotional brambles. By knowing our intentions we could spot the good crop from the bad.

Secondly we found that when we did this our actions naturally flowed in the same direction as our inner alignment. That's not to say that when we practice the ideas in this book that we are not capable of hurting others, or having bouts of dishonesty or stopping our ego running riot – but that these things were significantly reduced – and perhaps most importantly we spotted these things quickly and were able to make rectify wrongs promptly.

Here is an example to tie these thoughts down. Through our mediations we sought to be thoroughly honest in everything we did, we asked for patience from ourselves and towards others, we sought to take into account the feelings of others and our own feelings when conducting our affairs – and by simply asking these things – when we lived our lives we found that our actions naturally became more honest, we were more patient and we showed greater compassion.

So that we did not procrastinate we never set until tomorrow that which we could commit to today. There is only ever so much that can be achieved in a day. At any given point in our lives we recognised that we only ever have the present moment to take action. We can plan for the future, but we see that even that is a decision made in the present to prepare about something that will come later. For example, when we write a list of things to do tomorrow – we actually took a commitment today by making a reminder to ourselves and a positive reinforcement. Being prepared, when the time comes it is clear what needs to be done and we can do it.

Action has another benefit we found – it helped us learn what worked for us and what did not work. We found that certain things worked only in certain situations. This method of trial and error was essential for understanding the nuances of the ideas of theory when put into practice.

Finally by taking a succession of quick small positive actions upon awakening this laid the foundations for the possibility of greater achievement in the day. Indeed in times when we were feeling low or deflated, simple actions like making our bed, preparing a meal, going for a walk would not only lead us on an upward path but would give us a better chance of achieving greater things subsequently.

## 3. The Cost of Living

<span class="dropcap">T</span>his is the shortest chapter in the book – do not be fooled, it is one of the most important concepts – hence these simple ideas being given a chapter and not a sub-heading of their own. When we understand these ideas they guide us in so much that we do – we keep these thoughts with us daily.

### Everything is Free

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Kindess is free to give, but priceless to receive</em></div>

It was once said that "nothing in life is free", isn't it strange then that perhaps _nothing could be further from the truth_. The warmth of the sun, the wheat that grows from the earth – that makes the bread we eat, the love of people we have never met, good ideas and inner peace – these are all some of the most valuable things, essential to human life, and – that are freely available, if we work for them. Take some time to watch the birds, as they forage for food, collect twigs or build nests. Watch a cat find peace taking a nap in the afternoon sun. Has an animal ever paid for a single thing? Animals' homes, the food they eat, the relationships they make – all gathered using their own resourcefulness, which has been freely given to them at birth, and refined as they grow and learn. Make no mistake – the bird goes about his daily business, busy, working hard to find food and shelter. Some days the bird may find little food. In harsh weather life will be difficult for the bird. Luckily then, as humans, we have created more efficient ways of organising food production, clothing, housing supply, security and so on. Isn't it true that everything of fundamental value to us – such as food, love, shelter, warmth etc. is freely available if we search hard enough? If you work for something it will come.

### Everything comes at a Price

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Without effort, nothing grows but weeds</em></div>

How can it be that everything is free and yet everything has a price? Some things we may give freely or receive freely. Do not be caught out by the trap then that a free lunch will usually come without strings. Haven't we all experienced a one time or another an offer that seems too good to be true? Indeed, does the person offering a free lunch want something in return? Being aware of the motivations of others help us make informed decisions about what we choose to accept. So then, give freely and be humble in what you receive.

A lot of the time we make choices, or are forced into decisions about what we give or what we receive. Let us suppose a person is out of work. During this time their financial income may be reduced. This unemployed person is not bound by any conditions of employment. This person may have the personal freedom to spend more time with a loved one, to invest time in personal nourishment or pay a visit to a particular place. If I chose to take a walk in the park alone, enjoying the warmth of the sun, then is not the cost of this that I am spending time away from a friend or at the gym. Being aware of the opportunity cost of something will help you evaluate the personal value – values which change depending on circumstance, needs or available opportunities.

Lisa, a young woman became extremely wealthy at a young age. She had been promoted to the position of company director for a prominent new media company. Her salary elevated to a monthly sum she had only dreamed of as a teenager. Her financial remuneration was paralleled by her success, and she had worked hard to receive recognition for her abilities. Her story should be familiar with men and women of all ages. This woman had always experienced a strong sense of wanting, tied to a strong ambition - from a young age she felt that she always wanted more. She would recall the signs from her early childhood - when offered cake at parties she would long for a second slice. The rush of pleasure brought about by sugar tempting her to have another slice. In sports she was competitive and had a strong desire to win. She attended a good school and was well versed in all manner of academic subjects. She trawled additional writings for more and more knowledge, searching books and internet article to feed her fascination on all manner of subjects, first an obsession with horses and horse riding, later a craving for stylish clothes and handbags. No matter how much she acquired she always felt the need for more, never stopping once her craving was satisfied. The more it took to satisfy her craving the more she desired. One day Lisa felt that she reached a point where she had searched the world, but that nothing would fill her. The praise she received for academic achievement always faded after every success. The things she bought, her treasures, would after time bring her less and less pleasure. Lisa experienced a life changing event, her world had been shaken and this struck her to examine her lifestyle and question her values. Lisa now lives a different lifestyle. She is no longer burdened by the desires to gain material things, or chase ever increasing wealth and recognition. She is content with what she has, grateful for pleasures in life and is more at ease when she feels she doesn't know or doesn't understand something – more content that the answers to important questions usually resolve over time.

### What they are and how to decipher them

<span class="dropcap">E</span>motions are wonderful things, but they are also a burden. Without emotions we may be little more than robots, needlessly carrying out our lives with little panache and without enjoyment. Without emotion creativity may be more limited, love would surely be less passionate and our empathy would have far less potential for depth.

Sometimes emotions may be portrayed as being positive or negative – but this viewpoint may be limited in application. Anger which can often be classified as a 'negative' emotion can be extremely powerful in dealing with injustices and in those circumstances anger would be a valid feeling to be used as an indicator. Perhaps the secret to all emotions is to control our reactions when we feel them and how we channel our energies when directing them. When we feel anger, how are we going to react and how can we condition ourselves to avoid negative impulses? Hopefully our childhood upbringing and the environment we grew up in will have done a lot to help us in how we act upon our emotions. But it is not fair to ask the adults in our lives to prepare us for all situations. Often the deepest depths of feelings occur away from home, when we are trying things for the first time or when we least expect them. When we stop and think about it we have little control over the things that occur to us in our lives. Can we decide when it rains, or what a friend says to us? Do we control the news, stock markets or the traffic? Can we stop the tides or nature's desire to grow beyond its confines? To a certain extent we can choose where to live and the activities we engage in but we will never be able to stop all forms of actions towards us. It may be somebody telling us unwelcome news, an unpredicted turn in the weather or just plain bad luck. But we must accept that we can not control everything that occurs in our lives. In fact we may come to understand that the vast majority of most of what happens in our lives is beyond our control. The greatest arming trying to build a damn to stop the tides of the oceans for eternity or the most educated economists building a machine to accurately and reliably predict the stock market – in most ways that matter in trying to control things around you, you will surely fail – and in trying frustrate yourself. Have the wisdom then to accept that some things will happen that we can not change.

As equal as some emotions are portrayed as negative some emotions are thought of as positive, joy may be one emotion that falls into this category. It is certainly accepted among many that feeling joy is a positive experience – most of us can recall a time when we felt happy and how it made us feel. There is a trap here however, the constant pursuit of happiness can sometimes lead to dangerous paths. When we have a healthy reward system we tend to treat ourselves after an achievement, which could be a simple pat on the back, or eating our favourite chocolate bar. If we are not careful some of us will experience at some time or another the continual pursuit of chasing artificially created joy. Such activities range from alcohol consumption, eating sugar, gambling, clothes shopping, online gaming – the list is simply endless. These activities all have the ability to produce positive feelings, ranging from success, excitement, satisfaction, pleasure, achievement and joy. If we are not careful we may find ourselves in a situation of over consumption – a situation a psychologist may refer to as chasing a high.

#### Coping with emotions

There are few general guides in life that can honestly be applied in almost universal application. The following guide may be one of those few exceptions.

When dealing with emotion try and find the space between the impulse and your action; take a breath and let a cooling breeze come between the feeling and responding with heat. Interrupt your fierceness with a gentle peace and you will find the moment of calm that allows you to respond constructively. Sometimes what is needed is restraint of pen and tongue. Understand clearly what this means – say nothing in the heat of the moment, and respond when clarity settles. Sometimes a few breaths or counting to 10 is all that is needed, other times going to sleep and waking on a clear mind is needed – do not be afraid to let many days pass if deep lasting pain has been suffered. All this is easier said than done and takes a lifetime of application – start practicing by slowing down the space between your emotion and impulse and then learn to build up a gap between feeling and action. Be kind to yourself when an impulse does take over and do not hesitate to make amends for any wrong you have committed when an impulse or outburst has taken over. Remind yourself that you are human and that emotions are extremely powerful tools and take a lifetime to tame. Do not hesitate to improve yourself at once and if necessary put all your energies into learning to adapt your behaviours into positive actions.

Be careful therefore to treat each emotion felt as a helpful experience, taken within the context that they appear. When we learn to deal with emotions as indicators, then just as a barometer gives an indication of where the weather may be heading, it can be helpful in determining the outcome of a path we are on. And so just as a barometer is but an indication, do well to remember that indications are not infallible, the more data points gathered the better our prediction of an outcome will be. Applying our best attempt at common sense, taking the particular situation into context and applying our personal experiences will almost always give us a better information upon which to act than relying on primal instinct alone.

#### How to identify emotions

Sometimes it can be easy to identify how we are feeling – other times it can be a puzzle, a confused mess. Perhaps the easiest emotions to identify are sadness, anger and joy. We have experienced these a lot from a young age. We tend to instinctively know when we are happy, we may be laughing, we smile, we want to giggle, hug somebody perhaps. When we are sad we might cry, feel down, want time to ourselves or need to be hugged.

At other times you may know you have a strong feeling, you can sense that something different is being felt, or you may say that you are not your usual self. We may also feel confused or tangled up inside. This is understandable – we learn more about our feelings every time we experience them, we are always learning and evolving.

Putting a name to an emotion can sometimes be like putting a name to a face. We may see somebody in the street, recognise them but not remember their name. It could be on the tip of our tongue, and for some reason we just can't think of the person's name. It can happen to us at any time, this person could be an old school friend, or somebody we met at a party – we may even remember talking to this person. And that's OK – hold onto that, and maybe their name will come to you – and maybe the name won't. Simply being aware of this will help you identify the person at a later point in time – or in our case the emotion. And if you forget about this person tomorrow and their name doesn't come, then perhaps when you see them again it will come to you then. So then, do not be afraid to ask – when you meet up with another friend you can say, "hey I saw that girl we met last summer – she was wearing a yellow hat" – and bingo! Our friend reminds us that was Jenny. And we will both enjoy our time talking about Jenny – or in our case the emotion.

Let's put this into practice – start with describing the feeling to somebody – as best you can – if this is at all possible. They may be able to help you put a name to it straight away. Shame for example can be difficult to identify – we may have low self-esteem, similar to when we are sad or we may feel embarrassed, sometimes this is not something we wish to talk about or draw attention to.

Another trick is you use a dictionary – this has helped us. To continue with our example _Shame_ – the dictionary definition is "distress caused by wrong or foolish behaviour". So distress tells us it is similar to suffering or sadness, we might also say it's similar to feeling pain or fear, as both of these emotions have elements of distress. We can also see that we would probably feel shame after foolish behaviour – so if we had recently experienced this behaviour we might be on the right track.

### Fear

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>The fears we don't face become our limits</em></div>

Fear is probably the most powerful and controlling emotions. It is both a strong emotion and one that will crop up on a daily basis, without us necessarily being aware of it. Some of us may think we have outgrown fear, but we were mindful not to fall into this trap. When we lived our lives in the your comfort zone that did not mean that we had nothing to fear – we were certainly not immune to feeling scared. Other times our fears may be too eagerly present. In general our fears are born out of our concerns about the future. They are most often a result of something that you think may come to be. Even when the past is involved, a fear is usually about some future uncovering of the past - for example somebody finding out something we did when we were younger. Most often fear has little relevance with the present moment. In a truly threatening situation most people report that adrenaline and instinct takes over and that fear has little if any role when difficult moments actually come to play out.

#### Facing up to fears

As a practical exercise take a look at all the things you might fear, when you do this process be entirely honest with yourself and start with the assumption that you fear something – sometimes this will be obvious, other times perhaps when we are at our bravest we will have to dig a little deeper to identify real fear. More often than not when you identify one or two fears more will come to mind. Let's say that I am a father of two young boys, one fear that I have may be that of being a bad father. Notice that my fear of being a bad father has little if any relevance on what is actually the case. I may be a perfectly capable father, one who is able to listen to his children, a man who finds a lot of time can be spent with them and is able to support them in their needs. This may be the case - the fact that I am doing my best as a father, my fear shows little or perhaps no regard or respect of proportionality about what the case may actually be.

Fear can at times be crippling. The thought of something can be so overwhelming so as to stop us dead in our tracks. Biologically in this circumstance fear is acting the way it should. Through generations of evolution primal fear has served people well, healthy fear when faced with a potential grisly predator is designed to prevent us from putting ourselves into an even more dangerous situation than the one we are already in. In the modern life however fear comes about in a wider variety of social and economic situations. In recent times mass marketing and social media have amplified these effects. Advertising, which has the goal of promoting a product or service is known to be most effective when it taps into our motivations. A powerful way to sell insurance, for example, is to draw attention to what may come to be if the worst happens. By drawing attention to the worst outcome and triggering fear the advertiser may hope to evoke a strong emotional response. Facial makeup and purely cosmetic surgery often elicit a feeling of fear in the prospective buyer. A fear of growing old or perhaps a feeling of becoming less attractive to the opposite sex may be felt and act as a catalyst for somebody looking to buy these products.

Fear at the worst of times can prevent us from taking actions. A fear of failure is a common sense we feel when we are faced with uncertain outcomes. We may be attempting to learn a new skill, start an organisation or give a speech about a controversial topic – we may find that when facing these situations fear is either present and active in the form of an anxiety or laying dormant and manifest as self-doubt. Many motivational quotes have captured the spirit that the only failure is to not progress – we must honestly assess in these situations whether it is fear that is holding us back.

Fear affects our social interactions – if I am scared of how something I say will be received I may never say it. Most often if something that needs to be said is born out of love and good-will then how it is received is of little consequence. That is not to say that sensibilities should not be taken into consideration when talking to other – of course where possible every effort should be made to communicate effectively so that the receiver may hear the message with clarity. Certain situations will no doubt arise in day-to-day life where feelings or egos will be hurt because of something that is said or done. Fear of consequences is only an indication to us that we must tread carefully – not to be misinterpreted as a sign to not proceed at all. This indication should not be underestimated – fear is most likely to appear in unfamiliar territory where outcomes are unknown and our body is tell us to proceed with caution. Certain fears are more rational than others. Experience will help us determine when a fear is a rational one, or justified if the outcomes are likely to be difficult to navigate. Irrational fears can usually be identified by speaking to others to get a pulse check on drawing upon the experience of others. Speaking to other people is an extremely effective way of determining which fears are rational and whether our assessment of the fear at hand is proportional.

### Anger

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Where there is anger, there is pain</em></div>

Despite what may seem so on the face of it, anger is probably not the most powerful emotion. Anybody who has experienced deep sorrow, the loss of a friend, has felt an uncontrollable gut wrenching that can last days will say that deep sadness can outweigh even the fiercest anger. That said, hopefully deep sadness will be an emotion we only have to experience once in a while. Anger however, in small bursts of frustrations crop up daily unless we are completely serene and calm, like when we are on holiday. If we are lucky anger comes now and then disappears as quickly as it comes – unless facing a long difficult period or continuous adversity. Anger might be the most hurtful outward emotion. Just as fear, sorrow or depression sit inside us and eat away at us over time. Anger usually expresses itself outward towards others. Of course that is now always the case, anger can just as well be directed at ourselves – we might say "I'm annoyed I did that". Anger can become dangerously toxic – indeed unaddressed anger in the form of resentments can be extremely consuming.

Anger is an emotion we should prioritise to get under control as quickly as possible, we say that because crying, in comparison for example, due to sadness, can actually be a very helpful release, and one that is not outwardly hurtful to others – at least not immediately. Unaddressed anger is extremely dangerous. Sitting on an anger for a long time can become toxic or like a ticking bomb. And acting outward on anger through aggression or violence is extremely destructive and hurtful to others or anything, for that matter, that gets in its path.

So then what are the practical ways of dealing with anger. Firstly we must acknowledge there has probably never been a human to grace this planet that has been able to stop expressions of anger. All emotions are extremely important indicators, as we discussed earlier. So then anger may be unique in that it is the emotion we allow ourselves to feel, but we want to not allow ourselves to act on immediately. Practice this, first know that anger and aggression are two separate things. Aggression usually an outward expression of anger. Firstly then let us tame our aggression. Since anger is easy to identify the trick is to catch us in the moment it arrives, and not after it has passed since it is then too late. Two simple techniques to split the time between feeling and action is breathing and counting. Often these can be done at the same time – so we count our breaths, it is difficult to practice because we must truly be feeling anger for it to work – so then we must commit to memory, "anger – breathe, anger – breathe, anger – breathe" – say this as often as is necessary to make this stick. Practice in all the places you sit, a train journey, a doctor's waiting room, when walking and insert the relationship between anger and breathing into your mind so it becomes second nature.

Now that we have learned to insert a breath between anger and action we can practice every time taking more breaths, as many as needed but at least three for us to calm ourselves and respond constructively.

The second thing we can do is prepare ourselves to reduce our frustrations and chances of becoming angry. If we are well fed, tired or scared, anger is more likely to come. If we know we may be heading somewhere we might get angry prepare, prepare, prepare – eat some food, take some drink, exercise, or have a nap – all of these things will reduce our chances or the intensity of any anger we feel.

#### Conflict Resolution

This book – designed as it is to be a practical tool for everyday life – should know its limits. Conflict resolution is a complex topic, with intricacies which people study for many years to master. That said we present here the broad strokes – the basics if you will, for we believe these simple tools will aid in reducing the tension in those day-to-day situations which may inflame anger. Remember to seek out those books and guides which cover this topic in more depth, don't expect to master this topic from the few paragraphs below.

The first tool at our disposal – if we are discussing a difficult topic with somebody we remember to stick to statements starting with "I". For example instead of saying "you hurt me", say instead "I felt hurt". There are many reasons this works, firstly because you are taking ownership – it may be that you have misinterpreted something, so even though you felt hurt, the other person may not have intended to hurt you. It always creates less chance of the other person becoming defensive, which will cause conversations to spiral out of control, and the chances of frustration and anger creeping in from both sides increases dramatically. If you find yourself in this situation – stop talking, relax your muscles as best you can. Pause. Breathe and count to at least three or as much as you need and ask the other person as calmly as you can to take a break – in this situation the other person will usually be as relieved as you are. Do not come back to the topic straight away, take some time to walk, exercise, eat, sleep, drink and call a friend – talking things through with somebody else will help give perspective. Call the person you think will least likely agree with you. This may help you see things from the other person's point of view.

The last suggestion provided here regarding anger that might arise from conflict is to see things from the other person's perspective, give the other person the benefit of the doubt – perhaps it was a mistake or a misunderstanding. Be humble and take the first step to say "maybe I misunderstood". This will go a long way to helping the other person see things from your point of view.

#### A summary about anger

Remember all of this takes years of practice, especially conflict resolution, there are much better books suited to this topic, from professionals and doctors, hopefully these basics will remind you of the essentials. When we act out in anger in ways we are not happy with, we make amends for it at once – we admit our wrongs freely and honestly and do not allow fear to cloud our judgement on this point. Continue reading then and take heart that navigating difficult situations will take a lot of patience, time and effort. The priority is usually first to get anger under control through good preparation and practising inserting the breathing pause for as long as possible between emotion and action.

### Sadness

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>What brings us to tears, will lead us to grace</em></div>

Is sadness bad for us? Is it avoidable? Can we be at ease feeling sad? Practically all of us have experienced what is it like to feel sad, it is that downward feeling – sometimes accompanied by tears. Sadness can sometimes be portrayed as a negative emotion, but like the others we have noticed that sadness is simply an expression of how we are feeling. Without knowing sadness we may not be able to feel empathy, or recognise when something hurts us.

We can't always stop pain being caused to us, as we noted before, so much of what happens in our life is unavoidable - the loss of loved ones, disappointment at hearing test results or an environmental disaster. And when we feel sad it gives us a sense that we would like to change something. If we are fortunate then – some things can be changed, we may be well equipped to help ourselves overcome. The key to being able to change things is to think through our actions, we take time to process what we feel and when necessary speak to others. Being in a position to change things is fortunate and should not be taken for granted, expressing gratitude in this situation – we have found - increases the effectiveness of our actions. We do not force our actions on others – having confidence that our actions are born out of love and respect.

Other times we find that the situation we are in that is making us sad. So then we can't change the situation – but we can change our thinking about a situation. We remind ourselves of this example. Somebody we have known for a very long time has passed away, nothing we can do will bring back this person. We feel sad and that is understandable, loss of a friend is deeply moving and changes our life. So then firstly we may not wish to let go of sadness, as this is part of the grieving process – something we go through and change as a result. At other times we find other ways of looking at things – how may we pay tribute to our passing friend, can we show our love for that person in a meaningful and lasting way. We may pay tribute to where the person liked to spend their time, we may speak to mutual friends and remember what it was like to spend time with that person. We note that we hold on to all the experiences and times that we were with that person and that those thoughts and feeling will always stay with us.

We recall that the event of serious and deep lasting sadness, or even with sudden deep sadness our balance may have been extremely challenged. We strive to continue to do those things that we relied on in the past, remembering to take care of mind, body and soul. Going out and socialising may be the last thing on our mind, but we are social creatures and there is a healing process in being with others. We stay active and connect with the world around us, taking note of nature and watching the movement of trees in the wind or the daily business of the birds and the bees. These are not distractions but ways for us to remember that we are inherently connected to the world around us and to deny that is to cut off so much of what is available to us.

What if we can't identify the source of sadness? Sometimes we may simply feel sad and not understand the cause - this doesn't mean that we ignore the feeling altogether and the body rarely tricks us in these things. We take a note of all the times in the past we were sad were passing moments, so then this too will pass. There may be times when we have had lasting sadness or discontent – and we find that if continued unaddressed may lead to depression. If we find ourselves in this situation we do not hesitate to ask for help, not easy, but reminding ourselves not to let fear drive us to hesitation. In the most mild of cases we speak to friends or those who know us well enough, and we do all the things we would do if we could identify the source. In longer lasting and deeper periods of depression we seek out the advice of medical professionals who will have greater experience in dealing with these situations. Very rarely, if ever, have we seen a situation that could not be improved by practising the things we note in this book in all that we do.

### Joy, Excitement

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves</em></div>

Is Joy the opposite of sadness? Perhaps it is, but then again perhaps it is not – and this may be a matter of context and definition. Here then when we talk about joy, we mean feelings of great pleasure – it may be related to the times when we smile uncontrollably. Other times joy comes to us in the form of continued happiness. Some of us may be lucky in that we experience long continuous periods of joy that seem to defy all boundaries and help us overcome a variety of situations.

Excitement can also be fleeting, a sort of buzz that we find after a particular short activity - we may come to associate it with an adrenaline rush or a particular activity. Here we remember to be careful, that endless pursuit of ecstatic feelings may lead to greater cravings and a dependency on the source of release.

We try then to balance our joy as much as possible taking it in controlled periods when it comes and not forcing it artificially through drugs, extreme material pursuits and damaging ways. Drugs and alcohol are examples of pleasurable activities that come with side-effects. We remind ourselves that everything comes with a cost _(Chapter 3)_. We have found that endless material pursuits have a way in the long-run of catching up with us – we found that when we are snared in one of these traps – the only way out was through following the twelve steps in _Chapter 8 - Practical Daily Life_.

We do not shy away from living a joyous life, on the contrary we are extremely grateful for those periods of life that contain joy and happiness. We find that sometimes it is a matter of adjusting our outlooks, putting our priorities in order (do we favour personal gain over group wellbeing? do we take rest or engage in extended activity?) or we may reset what is important to us in life. These are all personal questions and only ones that can be answered with honest periods of reflection. We have found that even in the times of the greatest confusion that extended quiet inward reflection (for example meditation) followed by outward validation (for example speaking to others) help us identify the direction in which we point our energies. Remember that just as life changes and our balance needs to be topped-up regularly (daily), so then do our longer-term outlooks need to be calibrated as often as possible. We tend to consider personal improvement to be a daily habit – we have found the best results of personal welling are found when we reset our outlooks at every waking moment.

#### About happiness

Happiness is one of those words, we have found, that means many different things to many different people, in a wide range of situations – much like the previous example 'Love' in chapter 2, which can convey different ideas depending on the context. We get a sense of the variety of situations that happiness might be applied through our intuition and experience. We also note that different cultures have a better vocabulary for distinguishing between types of happiness - like our example of the word 'Snow' also from chapter two.

So then we see that happiness may be a variety of things, it may be felt for ourselves, or for somebody else when they achieve something, we may be lucky to find happiness over a longer period of time, or in short bursts when laughing. For many of us happiness is more than an emotion – it can be a long-term goal – for those of us with overly addictive personalities we may be cautious of seeking the next buzz. Other times we may relate happiness to passing moments in life, when things are on the up or when things feel good. It may be difficult to imagine long-term happiness if we are suffering from lasting deep pain, a sense of loss or during periods of depression. So then this book tends to differentiate between the shorter-term excited happiness that we refer to as Joy and Excitement and the perhaps, longer-term peace and contentment for which we tend to borrow the word Serenity.

### Loneliness

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Loneliness is not being alone, it is the feeling that nobody cares</em></div>

Let's first be clear what we mean when we talk about loneliness – for us it is not being alone. Having time to oneself is extremely helpful, should be sought after (in equilibrium with social time) and can give us vital downtime we need to recharge. Some of us prefer spending longer times alone whilst others have greater urge to spend time with others. We are all different – and yet each of us requires a balance of spending time with people and time to ourselves. But this is not what loneliness is about.

When you feel lonely you may have an abundance of people around you, you may have many work colleagues, a set of people you call friends and some family. Of course you are likely to feel lonely if you spend long periods in isolation – lack of healthy social interactions can cause feelings of loneliness.

So then here we mean loneliness to be the feeling that people do not care for us, or put another way that others lack empathy for us. However it is worth remembering that empathy isn't something we can turn on or off, empathy is more like feeling hot or cold. When we put our hand in water we can not shut off such a reaction to hot or cold water. In that sense feeling lonely can often be irrational, for if we remember that other people will and do feel empathy and care for us, people we have never even met – then we should never feel lonely. When we are suffering due to pain, we instinctively know that somebody else – if they knew of our situation – would relate to that.

There are a few ways in which we can reduce the feelings of loneliness, the first is to be of service to others. It takes only our time and effort to do something for somebody else – this can be as simple as making a cup of tea, listening to that person or spending time with them. These are all things we can do most of the time.

Another way to combat loneliness is to speak to others, asking about their lives, will help remove us from the chatter in our own minds. So we pick up the phone and call somebody – we check in on them and ask how they are doing – this human connection immediately makes us feel connected and reduces the feelings of loneliness.

We have learned through the years to combat the onset of loneliness by taking part in continuous healthy relationships. What then can we do if we have isolated ourselves to the point that we are scared whether people will accept us? Firstly we remember our fears, re-reading the earlier section we remind ourselves that fear is caused per a perceived threat. There is very little danger in talking to people who are open-minded. There are occasions when we may have lost trust in everybody – perhaps because we have treated people badly or other have treated us badly. So seek people who have been through a similar experience to you - when we did the same we immediately formed connections with others – and were able to start talking about the things that had happened – even in extremely traumatic situations.

Of course we may proceed with caution and apprehension – and this is OK, we remind ourselves that we may have been badly damaged if isolated or mis-treated for prolonged periods of time. The importance here to remember is that whatever you have been through, others will have been through too. We didn't believe it at first but we soon realised that even in the city or town we live in somebody has had a similar relatable experience. When we opened up to another human being the feelings of loneliness started to disappear. We found that believing we were cured and stopping these activities only caused us to slip further into loneliness. So then we make it a habit to connect with other people each day. Seeking out those whom do not seek to harm us. We needed like the person we are reaching out to – so long as there was no immediate threat of danger – we found that speaking to somebody else respectfully and hearing what they have to say was helpful to our own recovery.

There are other practical ways we found to combat loneliness which worked in a variety of situations. We volunteered and took up service positions whenever possible. If we were able we took part in social events, such as charity runs, we send notes to friends thanking them for what they have done for us. We asked people in what ways could we help them – could we pick them something up? A coffee or something for around the house? Another way we found helpful was to adopt a pet if we were able. And through learning to take better care of an animal we found ways in which to help ourselves. For we often that by learning to spot the needs of a pet: exercise, shelter, affection, food – we found it easier to identify our needs and those of others.

Listening to uplifting music was often helpful – it created both a reminder of a social connection, and through hearing lyrics of experiences shared - we found identification.

Joining group exercise classes we found also to be beneficial in many circumstances – the act of getting out of usual dwelling, meeting other people and doing moderate physical activity was uplifting on at least three counts.

As soon as we have reached out to others, offered and asked for help - we instantly felt less lonely.

## 5. Complex Emotions

### Jealousy & Envy

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Jealousy is insecurity hidden by bitterness</em></div>

<span class="dropcap">J</span>ealousy and envy – we have learned – are two of the most powerful emotions, and they can also be the most confusing. We do not wish to disguish here between the two, for even if there is any we wish to talk about the single feeling from which they arise. For simplicity we simply refer to _Jealousy_. The confusing nature of this feeling arises from the fact that it is something like a mixture of two or three emotions working in tandem and then directed towards somebody. Jealousy can be built on both fear (insecurities) and resentment (anger, injustice). Jealousy also works differently when we harbour it against somebody, versus when we receive it.

> What is jealousy? Simply put it is feeling or showing an envious resentment of someone or their achievements, possessions, or perceived advantages. A feeling of discontent or resentment aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck.

Jealousy can be felt just as intensely towards people we love as it can be towards those we may not even know. Why should we harbour ill feelings to somebody we love? And is jealousy rational?

Jealousy is born about through a sense of lacking or wanting. When we feel that what we have isn't sufficient we can look at somebody who has something and say "why should that person have what I want?". If we desire something so much and we don't have it – why should we resent or form hatreds towards those who have.

We found that to address jealously we needed to start by addressing our fears and insecurities. And by practicing gratitude. For if we loosen ourselves from our fears and are grateful for all we have we simply can not feel jealousy. Jealousy is then perhaps an advanced condition of mind and memory as opposed to sudden fright which might be a result of an immediate perceived danger.

The best ways we found to deal with jealously involve reminding ourselves of what we have, and what we really need to live our lives. Looking back on the section of _"Everything in life is free"_ we see that everything we could ever want is here for the taking and that we need to work for it. By writing our daily gratitude lists we find that we already have so much to be thankful for that perhaps the thing that we are jealous of doesn't really matter. We might see that somebody has a new pair of shoes, has achieved a promotion or been given a gift. When we reflected that we can gain these things through our own efforts the feelings of wanting start to leave.

By working on our fears and insecurities we found that jealousy had little space to crop up - for when we look at somebody else and see what they - if we have thoroughly addressed our own fears – we will see that each fear has a diminished real consequence.

Another time we found jealousy to crop up was in matters of romance. Perhaps we had just formed a new romantic relationship and we felt jealousy crop in when our partner looked at or talked to somebody else. We might be jealous that somebody else is dating the person we think we would like to be with. Or we might be jealous towards our partner if they have received something we wanted – such as a work recognition. In all of these cases we found that they were formed on the same insecurities. At different times we felt that we could not be loved, or that somebody would take the love we have away from us.

We found that in all these circumstances learning to love ourselves and seeing the value that we have was crucial. For if we could not love ourselves we had little hope of imaging that somebody could love us. We turned to the ideas in _Chapter 7 – Taking Care of Ourselves_ to help us in this endeavour.

### Self-pity

We learned that self-pity was perhaps not so much an emotion as a state-of-mind. Self-pity, we find, can be born out of a sense of injustice – the belief that something we were owed did not come to us or that something was taken that we were entitled to. Self-pity can also arise when we fail to correctly identify our _Self Worth_.

On the surface self-pity seems to indicate low-self worth, but often we find that the opposite was actually true. Self-pity can just as easily come from an elevated sense of self – or the belief that something we are entitled to was taken from us. When we wallow in self-pity we usually get caught up with the idea that we deserve more or better. It may be true that somebody has done something to hurt us, or that something we became used to was taken from us but we found that the act of loathing in self-pity did little, if anything, to remedy our state of mind. Better courses of action we found was usually either, writing out our gratitude lists, speak up for ourselves, practice _Self-love_, to practice acceptance or to be in submission.

Self-pity when directed internally is harmful, we find it tends to create a sort of internal resentment that then manifests as anger, bitterness or hatred. Channeled inwardly it also serves to boost the ego and to bolster our sense of self-righteousness. To overcome this we adopt the mindset that nothing in this world really belongs to us or is owed to us, our time on Earth is characterised by lending freely and borrowing what we need. We turn our thoughts around and instead of thinking about what we think is due to us, we look at what we can contribute back to the world.

Self-pity directly outwardly tends to have a different purpose. Its goal is similar – to boost the ego and increase self-entitlement. The action is different. Expressed outwardly, self-pity is an attempt to artificially invoke in others a sense of sympathy. The key here being artificially. A natural sense of empathy from others is healthy, we find that we should seek to honestly express ourselves and make no attempt to manipulate feelings towards us. We also found that trying to invoke excess sympathy had an adverse effect to our well-being (see _Empathy vs. Sympathy_).

### Guilt, Shame and Remorse

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Unless we let go and forgive ourselves, we can't move on</em></div>

This triad of emotions are cunning and require delicate attention. They are perhaps not as well known or understood by us as the more primary emotions of fear, anger, sadness and joy. It is for this reason that guilt and shame get swept under the carpet.

To unpick this triad lets see how they relate by our approximate understandings:-

**Guilt** - a feeling of having committed wrong or failed in an obligation

**Shame** - the pain of humiliation or distress caused by realising wrong or foolish behaviour.

**Remorse** - deep regret or guilt for a wrong committed

We have witnessed in many people, and ourselves a tendency to 'leave until tomorrow' to address these feelings – sometimes, even with the best intentions we never get round to dealing with them at all. If we are not careful, not being honest with ourselves, or simply ploughing through life not paying attention, we might think that we have conquered them. Beware of this trap – unaddressed actions that have led us to feelings of guilt, shame and remorse will slowly fester, and the carpet under which they are swept will soon become insufficient to hide them from our own consciousness. What is there to lose by taking stock of what is sitting below this rug?

There is of course a big risk here of allowing these shames and guilts to sit unaddressed – they can seriously affect our mental health and state of mind. In our own experience we carry around our guilts and shames likes heavy stones tied around our necks, we walk around with our heads low, looking at our feet – and if things get really bad we may not be able to face ourselves in the mirror. Do not be discouraged, there is a solution.

First we must lift up the carpet – there is no harm in looking, and if we want to remove the stench we need to see what we are dealing with. So then we see the mess, a sort of junkyard pile of broken things, things that have the chance of being mended if only we took a little time and effort. So we may see bits and pieces of things we haven't dealt with, a squabble with a friend, something we were not honest about with Mum or Dad, something we have been hiding from ourselves perhaps? If we are lucky the mess isn't too bad, nothing a little spring cleaning will not sort out. Sometimes the task at hand is a little more involved – we see some big things we couldn't ever imagine moving and too many things to deal with all in one go we feel. Our first instinct may be then to put the carpet down, deal with them tomorrow or try and forget about them altogether. Take a moment though and simply look – take some breaths, if necessary brew some tea. So we come back again and see that the initial shock has passed. And we think that actually one or two of these smaller items are easily fixed. We can leave the big ones for later. So then, having gained some courage, and deciding to try and knock off a few small items we start a process of writing down all the events that have caused guilt and shame.

Perhaps lifting the carpet is too scary a prospect altogether – so then we read the section on fear and remind ourself that no good will come from inaction. We take strength that the job at hand is just to take an inventory – we are simply writing down all that is under the carpet. So then we put pen to paper without delay, writing out a table of who we harmed, what we did to hurt/wrong them, what could we have done instead and most importantly are we prepared to own up and fix the situation?

So here is a suggested table for reference:-

| Who I harmed   | How did I hurt them?        | What could I have done?                   | Am I ready to fix it? |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| _Sister_       | _Took money from her purse_ | _Ask to borrow money_                     | _Yes_                 |
| _Ahmed Kateef_ | _Spoke to him unkindly_     | _Take more time to think before speaking_ | _Yes_                 |

If we do this process thoroughly and honestly we hope to immediately feel a weight lifted, but do not expect that – for we may just as easily feel exhausted from the exercise, emotional and ready for bed. The point is we've sorted out the mess of guilts and shames we have, owing to the wrongs we have done people and knowing that if we want to stop these guilts and shames eating away at us we should do something about it.

Now then we remind ourselves of the emotional burden carrying these guilts and shames around with us does to us – no matter how small. Consciously we may feel bad, perhaps the people we harmed have stopped talking to us, or inviting us round – and we questioned why this was as we could not fathom it. These guilts and shames may have been sitting waiting for us to go to sleep and then haunting us in nightmares. The psychological impact on our wellbeing has undoubtedly been tremendous.

With that in mind we are hopefully armed with the determination to remove these guilts and shames and through the power or remorse, bring about the healing process for ourselves. We look down our list and we see where we are able to make amends – this willingness alone can be a powerful experience – lifting us with a sense of confidence. Or it may scare us. Either way the only way for us to be lifted of these burdens is to start a healing process. We look at the list and see where making an amends would be something of benefit – making sure that any such reconciliation attempt would hurt nobody in the process. We certainly do not want to add more garbage to the heap. It is our experience that there will be one or two amends that can be made quickly and simply. A simple phone call, a message or an invitation to meet face to face will usually suffice – remembering to put nobody in harm as a result of these actions.

So then it goes that we first acknowledge the wrong we did – stating only our part in it, we do not seek to deflect or lessen our part – and we certainly do not want to highlight any fault in the other – as this would only cause greater friction and unnecessary pain. We may feel that we have been equally wronged by the other person but this should be put to one side, for we remember this process is to release ourselves from the pain of guilt and shame – it is neither an apology nor something that we do simply for the other person. The person we speak to may well feel better as a result and we surely hope that to be the case, but do not expect an easy ride each time. We have done this process many times and when we have done so we have had many different responses. The first we have seen often is the quick reconciliation – both parties lifted by the talking and a friendship is hopefully restored. This is the best case. In other situations the other person has simply forgotten all about what had happened and employed us to think nothing more of it. In few cases the other person is not ready to hear our message or is still angry about our actions. In the most testing of cases their response is anger or frustration. Do not be discouraged, it may be that time will still pass and the other will come to terms. Or they may simply never overcome their feelings. This should not discourage you – as for your part you will know that you have done what you can – and that you will continue to look open this person with love and respect. It may be still that time will change the sentiment. The point is that through this process your guilt and shame will be reduced if not removed entirely.

Through this process then you have taken stock of the rotten eggs, hopefully cleared many away, and in the most challenging of cases, set aside those that are simply too overwhelming to deal with today – if you have been honest in this process you will have lifted much baggage and your own healing process has begun. Starting with the smaller wins will give you much needed courage and experience if the larger issues are every to be mended. Once you have had time to sleep, rest and reflect, look then again at the list and see which you are able to tackle.

As a final note, we didn't treat this as a one-time process  – neither did we think of this as a spring cleaning exercise to be done once a year – make it a daily habit and you will stay on top of your wellbeing. So now that you have cleared out the wreckage, the idea is to keep your house in order. Practice daily inventory. At the end of each day take an honest look and see if there are any wrongs you have done and be prepared to close those out just as promptly and thoroughly as you have done before. Make it you goal to do this each day and you will never find that the situation under the rug is too challenging to deal with.

### Suffering

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>From suffering emerge the strongest souls; the biggest characters are born of scars</em></div>

Is suffering avoidable? What is its purpose? Is it necessary?

Suffering some say is inevitable, indeed we know a whole way of life – Buddhism has dedicated much to the idea of suffering. Perhaps to be human _is_ to experience suffering. Knowing this and accepting this very fact can of itself reducing the burden we carry. We remember that everybody suffers, in fact we find that to forget this is to harden our hearts to the troubles of others. We try to give others the benefit of the doubt and do not suppose they are free from suffering.

Most, if not all of us, have suffered to some degree or another, how much of our suffering was caused by the actual situation we were in and how much more suffering did we experience because of our own thinking about the situation?

Intuitively many of us feel that suffering and pain go hand in hand. For if you feel nothing, then do you feel your suffering? Counter-intuitively it is possible to suffer without knowing or being in pain. We may be oblivious to the suffering we are going through, or maybe numb. Many of us have suffered without knowing at the time and only looking back have then experienced the echos of pain.

Suffering we feel is part of the human condition, it is part of the advanced nature of our minds. Certainly we know it is possible to suffer memories of the past and projections of the future. Without these powerful tools suffering the past and the future would not be possible. Without good memories we would not be able to re-live past traumas, experience regret, or suffer things that have already happened. Without the capacity to ask "what if" or "if only" we could not become anxious about the future.

So then part of the secret to reducing the suffering we feel, if we can at all, is living in the present moment (see section _Living in the Present_). For us this is easier said than done – the central idea to living in the now being to focus on what is around us and for being grateful for the things closest to us.

Having got this far we have already done much to work on our fears (see sections on _Fear_ and _Guilt, Shame & Remorse_). By making a list of our fears honestly we can come to understand where they come from and what we can do to overcome them.

A lot of suffering then comes from the mind, and since part of it is a byproduct of our thinking we can reduce our suffering by changing our thinking. This comes to us as a huge relief, for there are many situations that we can not change the externals of – we have seen these often int his book – but we can change our thinking. How then may we turn our ideas around? Firstly we can speak to somebody who has been through a situation similar to that which we are suffering, by reaching out they will be able to shed a new light and new ways of thinking that we find help us. We can spend some quiet time, to ourselves, evaluating our priorities – for by changing what is important to us, we may reduce the impact of something that is causing us suffering. We can turn to our ideas of acceptance and submissions – these two tools being extremely helpful to us in reducing pain felt from suffering – by changing how we perceive a situation and how we prepare for an outcome.

Just like other emotions and related states-of-mind feeling suffering, perhaps through pain is an indicator. We are reminded of an old saying that typically applies to hard physical exercise at the gym "No Pain, No Gain". This concept we found was applicable too in this situation. Going through suffering is perhaps synonymous with going through a period of change, and a period of change we found to be an opportunity for personal growth. So as we get older, and hopefully wiser, this can only be true if we have suffered. Indeed those few of us who had not suffered were not sufficiently prepared for change and improvement.

We learned then, over time, to channel our suffering into positive change, whether it be to our personal character (*Chapter 6 Building Character) or when working with others - through sympathy and empathy. Without suffering we were perhaps 'in our comfort zone', and this lead us to complacency and mediocrity – which of themselves in the short-run were perhaps harmless, but when applied long-term could lead to some serious lack of house-keeping of our own emotional baggage (see *Practical daily life - 12 steps\*).

### Sympathy vs Empathy

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Sympathy is witnessing somebody's misfortune, Empathy is understanding it</em></div>

Why should we choose to draw a distinction between sympathy and empathy? What really are the differences and does it matter? Firstly lets distinguish between sympathy and empathy – for although they are related there is a subtle difference.

Sympathy we found is feeling pity or sorrow towards somebody else's misfortune. Despite how it sounds sympathy is helpful when expressed towards somebody else as it allows them to validate that you have acknowledged their feelings. This is helpful for the other person to know that their feelings are recognised and gives them some hope that others may be able to help. For short periods of pain sympathy can be an extremely effective remedy for the person in pain. There is a trap here however – we have found that giving too much sympathy for too long when something else is needed often has the opposite effect. An example might help illustrate this. Say somebody has had a misfortune, then we presume the best thing for them is to get out of that situation. This isn't always the case as we have seen before, some situations can not be changed or mended. When we feel sadness or sorrow these feelings are likely a healthy part of our recovery. The trap is that too many expressions of sympathy we have found can actually cause us to become comfortable in an undesirable situation. It is a temporary solution much like taking a painkiller to take the edge off a passing pain. If the pain really is passing then empathy will be helpful. But if the pain is long-lasting sympathy will simply provide a situation where we can tolerate the unwanted situation for longer than is necessary – we have experienced this both first and secondhand.

Empathy on the other-hand is being able to understand and share in the feelings of others. Achieving empathy requires that we not only recognise what the other person is feeling but that we have some experience in feeling it ourselves. Therefore, we were not always able to empathise with everybody's situation. We always found that learning to be more empathetic was in general a positive thing. Showing empathy towards somebody requires us to be delicate and careful. For example if somebody has lost a loved one – we should be careful not to take away from what the person is feeling by relating that we too have lost somebody in the past – this will be of little consequence to the feeling the person is feeling now. We can express empathy by through kindness and understanding – and helping the other person to talk about what they are going through. We found that the best way to connect with somebody using empathy is to say simply "I can relate to that". Most time nothing more is required that this. Note that it is different from how we express sympathy which is usually expressed as "I'm sorry for this". This example highlights how empathy can be a more powerful and meaningful way to connect to somebody. Indeed most times we were able to express empathy we were able to start a constructive conversation with the person in pain and through this dialogue help them in their grieving process.

In summary we find it more effective when we can offer empathy rather than sympathy – but we always strive to be honest and genuine in our expressions. Empathy can be built through asking questions like "how are you feeling?", "how can I help?". It is perhaps these two single questions that are the most effective in relating to how others are feeling – these ideas are developed further in _Chapter 6 – Working with Others_.

## 6. Ego 🔄

> 3434 words

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Be yourself — everybody else is taken</em></div>

<span class="dropcap">T</span>his is where we find that things get interesting. At the very least the ego is a fascinating and complex structure.

When we first think about our Ego — _Stop_.

Let's read that again slowly. "When we first think about our Ego". This is an odd phrase, isn't it? When we are disappointed we say "I'm not happy with myself". When we do well we might say "I'm so pleased with myself". So this ask the question "who _is_ I?", and "Who is _myself_?". Are these two different people?

We came to understand that our ego is like a feedback loop. At a moment in time we can ask questions of ourself – we can even ask "why am I asking this question?". We can think well of ourself or we can think poorly of ourself. As humans we have a unique gift – that we can think of ourselves at all…

What practical value does understanding that our ego is a feedback loop provide? Well, we found it goes a little something like this. Since it is possible to think of myself – I can ask the question "How do I see myself?". I am capable of holding an opinion of me. Does a dog hold an opinion of itself?

At any moment in time we are, for example, content or discontent. Happy or sad. Responsible or irresponsible. And we have seen that feelings are not just "felt" or "unfelt" – they can have an intensity. So we might assign a score one to ten (for example) for our level of content. If I assign myself a score of 10/10 – I am so content I wouldn't even lift a finger right now. I am well rested, well fed, happy with my bank balance, comfortable with the room temperature, all my relationships are in a good place, I am content with every aspect of who I am and my life situation. At the other end of the scale I might assign a zero. I am in complete discontentment – I am not at ease with who I am, I am hungry, I need sleep, I am concerned about personal finances etc. So we can see in reality on a day-to-day basis we might float somewhere between a 3 and an 8 say.

When all elements of our ego are in check we are balanced, we are not over-confident, we do not have a low-opinion of ourself, we are not overly-excited or depressed. When we evaluate ourselves we have to be entirely honest. For without this honesty we are capable of misrepresentation. And there can be dangers when we do not accurately and honestly evaluate. If I am already sitting at optimum confidence level but I come to believe that I lack confidence. I take steps to increase my confidence to the point I am now overly confident. Over-confidence, or hubris, can lead us to all sorts of troubles. We can deceive ourselves, a situation where we might say we are deluded. We can become detached from reality and when we base of decisions on an overly confident position we are most likely in for a shock when things do not go as we might expect them to.

If our ego is in check, and we are humble and have humility then we have typically found that we are in a good place to contribute to making honest, kind and compassionate decisions.

So we take care then to accurately evaluate ourselves so that we do not put ourselves in a situation where we have an overly-inflated perception of self.

So we can have an inflated sense of self worth – we might refer to this as 'false pride', 'cockiness' or 'arrogance'. In this condition we place ourselves above all others. Our needs become the most important at the cost of others. Here we found that we had a sense of entitlement – that we were owed everything and owed nothing to anybody. When we were in a state of over-inflated ego we tend to make decisions based more on self. We found this to be typified by self-seeking behaviour – we might be tempted to lie, cheat, or push somebody else down to get what we wanted. This obviously causes harm to others and when we were in this state of mind we didn't even stop to consider the feelings of others. We showed a lack of empathy and when we did show sympathy it was usually a cheap imitation without meaning – something expressed to make us look good rather than to comfort the feelings of others. Over-inflated ego was a trap, we found, that was hard to identify – for when we were in this state of mind we could not evaluate ourselves honestly – such that our thinking had become corrupted over a period of time. So we made a list of warning signs to help us spot this in ourselves, so that we might be able to take steps to remedy it:-

#### Spot an Inflated Ego

1. We saw others as beneath us
2. We were constantly defensive
3. We made comparisons; often to elevate ourselves above overs
4. We overtly sought disproportionate recognition for everything we did
5. We looked at others as competition, somebody to 'beat', winning at all costs
6. We were mean or rude to others constantly and showed no recognition of wrongdoing
7. We always wanting more; we were greedy
8. We always talked about ourselves, and did not ask others how they were doing
9. We had the need to always be right
10. We needed to have the last word
11. We showed off excessively
12. We did not listen to other's points of views; rejecting any ideas except our own

### Self Worth

What makes us who we are? And how do we value our worth? When we were young we were told – "you can be anything you want to be".

People, places and things do not define us. Yet we have a tendency to let them. Once they become part of our definition of who we are – psychologically we associate our worth with those things.

Part of acceptance is knowing that we are who we are. Once our appreciation of self is not tied up with things, other people and places then we free ourselves from a certain bondage that holds over us. We have found this acknowledgement to be a liberating exercise. And like with a lot of things we have to come back to this idea of self-worth as there is a tendency for new things to creep in and once again become part of our self identiy.

When we let something define our self worth, such as money, a job, a relationship or a place – we are at risk. When these things are taken away from us we see this as a blow to who we are. When we lose a job, lose a close relative or move house we experience this sense of loss to one degree or another. It is important to remind ourselves that these things do not define us.

We have seen in _Ego & Humility_ that we may have under or over appreciation of ourself. The key here is to appreciate ourselves _as we are_. Yes we should strive for better and yes we are capable of faults – but lack of ambition or humility doesn't mean we are worth less.

#### Low opinion of self

Just as we can have an elevated or opinion of ourselves (overconfidence, cockiness etc.) so too can we have a low opinion of ourselves. We find this to also be a dangerous position to be in, which can lead to _Self-pity_, sadness or at the worst of times depression. It can cause us to become overly introverted and to not stand up for ourselves. The point here is that we are worthy. We owe it to ourselves to recongnise this.

We can combat low-opinion of ourselves through self appreciation (see _Love Yourself_).

### Love Yourself

<div style="text-align: center" class="quote-title"><em>To love yourself is to accept the experiences that shaped you</em></div>

We came here often to read this section. A lot of ideas in this book require a lot of work and a lot of practice, the idea of loving ourselves we found to be no different – luckily we found some simple and effective tools for loving ourselves. Without love for ourselves we could not love others. Love for yourself will keep you balanced and it will keep you strong in the face of adversity. We have found that being tough on ourselves for small mistakes only added to our frustrations.

Having read the section on emotions we already know that life will put us through a lot, we will have highs and lows and good days and bad days. It is just as important to love ourselves on the good days as it is when things do not go our way. Showing love for ourselves was the central core to our ideas. This love included self respect – making sure that the activities we engaged in were good and healthy for us.

#### Practical ways of loving yourself

We show our love to ourselves by making a list of all our strengths, we looked honestly at the things we are good at in life reminding ourselves of all our accomplishments. By reminding ourselves of what we are good at it helped us see ourselves in a positive light. Performing small acts of kindness, that we didn't seek recognition of thanks for, on a daily basis was always available to us.

We treat our body and our life with respect, eating well, exercising the body and the mind each day. We noted that in order to respect ourselves we must have the courage to say no to the things that are not right for us, for just as it is importing to say yes with open arms, we must know when something is harmful. Honesty is central to this end, ending each day with a sincere reflection on all the things we did right and finding encouragement and strength to achieve more tomorrow.

When we made a mistake we rectified it immediately if required, or moved on and forgave ourself – remembering that it was important to have had good intentions in our actions – but reminding ourselves that we are are not saints.

We remembered to be grateful for the small things in life, creating daily lists of all the things that we appreciate. These lists keep us grounded we find, to put into perspective what matters to us and to help us spot purely materialistic gains that serve nothing but our own self-seeking. We remember all the things that make us smile no matter how small – these lists became part of what we were grateful for.

We choose to be present for our lives, looking at what is here now and taking pleasure in the small things around us, taking note of the details in nature, listening to all our senses including, smell, touch, sight and sounds.

We made fun a priority, for in order to love ourselves we needed to treat ourselves to positive and constructive actives we enjoy – including both time to ourselves and socialising with people that make us happy. We moved away from activities that were harmful to us.

We took time to learn a hobby, following those pursuits that we most enjoyed. This allowed us to develop a sense of pride and healthy ambition. Tending to plants or taking care of a pet we found to be great ways to both remind us how to look after ourselves and to channel our energies into care for something outside of ourselves.

We spoke kindly to ourselves – remembering that self respect is just as important as self discipline. For if we could not be kind to ourselves we found we had little hope of being kind to others.

Finally we took time in each day to rest and to recharge our energies, remembering that to fully enjoy ourselves we needed to have some downtime.

### Humility

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Ego will burn you, and humility rises from the ashes</em></div>

Humility is characterised by having and showing grace in our actions. It is a state of mind where we neither have a high sense of self worth or a low sense of self worth. It is also characterised by being honest with ourselves and other people.

Humility is perhaps the art of not thinking less of oneself, but thinking of oneself less often. When we are caught up in our own thoughts, there is a tendency for everything to become about us. When a storm breaks out, or the traffic is bad we tend to think about how it effects us. Remembering that other people are also going through tough experiences can help us put our own experinces into perspective.

Humility is a daily practice – we must work hard to keep it in check. Gratitude lists are always a good starting point for resetting our callibration of humility. Picking up the phone and speaking to friends and family and listening to them is also another great way we can practice humility.

#### Staying Humble

Knowing how to spot our overinflated ego (see _Spot an Inflated Ego_) we make every effort to keep our egos in check and to remain humble. Since our ego likes to take the spotlight and if not kept in check could become unbalanced we continued to do things that would measure us with a sense of humility.

To stay humble we found that we needed to always be in a position to help others, this could be and usually started with relatively small acts. We called friends and family often and asked how their days were – we made an effort to listen to other people's struggles and did so without judgement, or speaking down. Instead of forcing 'help' on others we would ask 'is there anything I can do to help'. We often found listening was as powerful as trying to help, which sometimes had the adverse effect – especially if we tried to force help on others. We took care of our own laundry, literally and metaphorically. We recognised that there was no job that was beneath us – we may be busy people but after all we found it important to keep our egos in check. We took out our own rubbish and cleared our own plates from the dinner table. We offered small acts of service to others, picking up their plates from the dinner table when we took ours. We always made time to speak to and listen to others – no matter how busy our days were – perhaps especially when we were busy and caught up in our own affairs. We learned the concept of 'getting out of our own heads' – for our own thoughts would resonate in our minds, causing them to echo and become louder and louder – listening to the strifes of others helped put our own thoughts into perspective. We asked for honest feedback from others, not seeing to be defensive but listening to their thoughts and trying to understand where they were coming from – for even if we disagreed with the view point entirely, we could at least entertain where they were coming from. We admitted when we were wrong and promptly admitted it. We learned to identify our weaknesses, reminding ourselves of our shortcomings and seeking to improve ourselves. We show appreciation at every opportunity especially when we received the smallest and most personal acts of kindness from others. We held the door open for others to walk through – literally and metaphorically. When we had achieved success we recognised the help and the work of others that had enabled us to reach where we did .We did not boast. When we performed acts of kindness we did not make a big fuss about it, blow a trumpet or advertise it to the world – we did so quietly without seeking recognition. We learned to take ownership and responsibility for our actions (see _Ownership and Responsibility_). We lived a love of submission and rigorous honesty for these things also ensured we had a solid foundation upon which to be humble (see _Submission_ and _Rigorous Honesty_). We did not speak badly of others and did not seek to judge others actions – we accepted that others were just as prone to making mistakes as we are.

### Your Biggest Weakness is Your Biggest Strength

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>You'll never know how strong you are,<br />until your weakness is tested.</em></div>

Doesn't it seem impossible that our biggest weakness could be our biggest strength? How can a weakness be a strength at all?

Many of us didn't understand this at first. This concept is perhaps as counterintuitive as any in the whole book. Maybe the meaning of this is something to be chewed over, like an ancient proverb. So let us start with the chewing.

The first step we found was to understand our weaknesses and shortcomings. This involved a process of honesty and internal reflection. We built this process into a continuing habit (see _Practical daily life - 12 steps_)

Having identified our weaknesses, what could we do about these. We were able to work upon them and build character around them. Knowing what our weaknesses were, was the first step to turning them into strengths. We found that by understanding where our weakness came from and seeing it in a different light – we were able to turn them around.

As children some of us never listened to the adults in our life. We were constantly told that our biggest weakness was our inability to listen and to sit still, we were unable to pay attention. We got bored quickly and this sometimes got us intro trouble, inside and outside of school. Later in life this same capacity may have got us into trouble in our employments or relationships. How then could this be our biggest strength? This very same power that kept us restless and unable to listen, was a power that we learned to harness, we channelled this energy into thinking outside of the box, not being content to settle for things as they were. We used it to challenge the status quo, as a force for innovation and for finding new ways to do things. We found that the energy that kept us uninterested for long periods as a child could be channelled into a power that could be used to consider things from a multitude of angles. Whilst some people became specialists in one discipline, our strength became our ability to learn fast and challenge conventional thinking.

As a child some of us could not keep quiet, we constantly talked and we would never stay quiet. As adults we learned to become professional coaches or speakers.

Some of us were restless and had excess energies, we were told we were mischievous, always fiddling with objects and breaking them apart. As adults we found that this energy could be channelled into sport, or becoming a personal trainer. Our constant breaking things, meant we had a superpower for fixing things, putting things together and understanding how they worked.

Some of us had strong emotional feelings and as a child we spent a lot of time in fear or sadness because we felt everything so deeply. As adults we became super-empaths, we were so in tune to our supercharged feelings that we could help others, we became social workers and had kindness on tap. For learning to be kind to ourselves growing up we had learned to be compassionate for others.

We must remember that the opposite can also be true, it may be that we are physically strong, we may be good at sport, especially perhaps martial arts. But this physical strength we posses can be a weakness, if we do not channel it in the right way or learn to harness it correctly, it has the capacity to do a lot of damage. Have a good memory can be a huge benefit to many, helping us remember ideas and picking things up quickly. But this same advantage can be a burden, forcing us to remember our past pains, sorrows and sufferings. With great power comes great responsibility.

### Start with Balance

<span class="dropcap">H</span>aving balance before we reach for loftier goals often provides greater chance of success. Without balance you may find that practical guides will result in little or no benefit. Balance is so important in life that it is suggested to spend the majority of our time striving for balance. Do not be easily fooled, balance is not something that can be achieved and then forgotten about. It has to be a daily effort. Start each day accepting that your balance will be challenged. Your sleep, health, state of mind, well-being and diet will contribute to your balance subtly and in a variety of ways – indeed, when you are, you may not feel unbalanced but it is surely better to be cautious than overconfident in the assessment of your current state of balance.

Many techniques are available to us to achieve balance. Exercise, rest, positive social interaction, good nourishment, meditation are all things that will tend to increase our level of balance. Spend a good amount of time each day cultivating your balance. On the other hand, tiredness, poor diet, isolation and a crowded mind are some of the things that tend to decrease our level of balance. Try to avoid activities that will decrease personal balance, although sometimes this is unavoidable.

Start each day with the assumption that you need to reset your balance and expect each day to bring against you things that will sway you. Most of all be prepared each day for your tower to fall – knowing that one day such an event will come, this will hopefully help reduce the shock of a complete knock to your balance when it does come. Being prepared you'll be better able to pick up your pieces, resetting your balance, and building a new platform of balance in your life. To be more specific, some days life will feel easy, things will seem to go your way and confidence and enjoyment will appear in abundance. Other days life will seem to demand more from you, you will feel challenged and pushed to your limit or beyond your boundaries. This is normal, and each person who has graced this world has experience of this in some degree or another. Every now and then something will happen to you so as to shock you and may completely rock the foundations your assumptions are built on, it may be the death of a close friend, a perceived severe injustice, diagnosis of an incurable disease. With the foreknowledge that one day a shock will come it may be possible to take the sting off such a shock, but do not expect that because you are aware of possibilities the reality of a situation will be any less devastating when it does come to be. In that moment remember this moment too will pass, accept the feelings that you have been given and allow your feelings time to communicate to you. Most importantly seek the guidance of others, when the foundations of your mind are challenged it will be of little practical use to rely on your own devices or experience. When you are lost at sea it is better to call upon somebody to help guide you, that can perhaps provide a constant beacon on dry land, than to brave the waters alone and risk drowning. Rarely in life are the waters in which you are swimming not understood by others. It is often easier from the outside looking in to make greater sense of a situation, with or without relevant experience – it is perhaps easier because of not being caught up in the situation or through looking at it with fresh eyes. Whatever the reasons, seeking a second opinion usually provides beneficial results.

### Submission

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>“Let things flow forward naturally in whatever way they like.”</em></div>

Submission is a fairly common and broad concept. Is submission the same as giving in or tapping out?

The concept of submission may come to you as a familiar word – something that you practice often. For some of us it was a new idea, something that we had to experience. To be more specific we may say that we are submitting our will – leaving ego behind.

By submission we mean then the idea of turning our will over and letting be what will be. Submission we find is related to acceptance. If acceptance is something we must show for a particular event or situation, then submission is something we do to live our lives by so that we may always be prepared to accept. We may consider submission of one's will a motto or a way of life perhaps.

Submission does not mean being a carpet, it does not mean allowing everything and everybody to walk over you. Submission we learned is not about giving up our ambitions or goals. What then do we mean by submission? First we must have already accepted that many things, if not most things that happen in the world are beyond our control. So then acceptance may be the first step on the path to submission. Secondly submission is about being in a position to receive and, for when we are busy giving we may not receive. When we submitted we found that we were naturally ready to listen and to hear the thoughts on others. When we submit, we do it entirely, to hold on to a blade of grass, no matter what, is not submission. We can not then pick and choose what to submit to – we find that we are either in a state of submission or we are not.

Submission means that our will, our soul driving force is not powered by our self-seeking desires. We calibrate our internal driving force to the world around us. Rather than swim against the tide to the point of drowning, we become a raft, a place of refuge that provides a haven for others consumed by the stormy water. When we submit we set our self-motivated objective aside and find a common purpose that aligns with our needs.

Submission does not mean not saying what is on our minds or letting go of our positions – it means that we turn our convictions over to the care of the world. Indeed we must put in the hard work but not hold onto the notion that any outcome will happen. We may hope for the results, but not expect them and we certainly let go of any ideas about entitlement. Let's say we we would like to grow apples, so we decide to plant a tree. When we live in submission we are in a position of pre-acceptance that we may never grow one apple. It may be that the seed does not take to the soil, or that after a few years good growth the tree is killed off over a bad winter. It may be that once the tree is fully grown it never bears fruit. To live in submission is to live with hope but not expectation. It's to do something for the pleasure in the activity not the entitlement to the outcome.

Submission does not mean accepting defeat – in fact it means to change the rules of the battlefield, to lay down our arms and find a peaceful solution. When we are in submission we are like a fish in a lake. We know which dangers to avoid, we are destined to allow the water to flow over us, without letting it control us too much, or swaying us from our course when the waters are calm. When rapid waters arrive and it would be futile to swim upstream, we conserve our energy, knowing that the quick currents will pass as they do.

When we live within submission we learn to master temptations that would otherwise lead us on a path of harm or destructive behaviour. We find that because we are already fully submitted to the world around us we do not desire to submit to every base impulse, be that sex, drugs use or consumption. When we are in submission we find that we are net providers to the universe rather than net consumers.

When we have fully submitted we found that we were also fully available. To be available to the needs of others, whether it be time, to listen or to lend, or give freely the things we have.

### Ownership and Responsibility

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Find no fault or blame. Stand up and say 'I will help'.</em></div>

When we take ownership we stand up and say "I will take care of this", "The buck stops with me". When something goes wrong, when shit hits the fan, it is easy to start pointing fingers – mistakes are easy to find. It takes effort, patience, and thought to identify solutions. We find that identifying solutions and working through them resolves issues a lot quicker than pointing fingers. When we take ownership we do not seek to find blame – we set blame aside for it is not relevant to the solution. Something has occurred and we focus on the solution. Blame has a negative effect as it causes the recipient to feel shame, which we find generates anger or triggers a defence mechanism – which hinder the solution process. Statements like "you caused this" can be polarising, especially when the other person's intentions were not to inflict, so we avoid them altogether. We found it to be productive to take ownership through use of "I feel this" or "I sense that". These very statements are taking ownership – the responsibility is mine, not somebody else's. If we all take that attitude then we are all working to a common goal.

When we take ownership we look at what we can contribute to a situation rather than looking for the fault. Highlighting the cause may be enough to find a solution, but drawing attention to other people's shortcomings unnecessarily rarely helps, and only adds to the set backs we faced.

When we heard the question "who can help", we respond always with "I can". For we found that when we took ownership and responsibility we were always able to help in some way. Being present and being available were the least we could offer and in many situations this was sufficient to resolve the situation. Even in the cases that required a lot of commitment, we almost always had the capacity to help find solutions that didn't require our continued effort or input.

When we take ownership we find we are naturally contributing to finding solutions. And when we start finding solutions we are all able to move forward.

It has been said that responsibility is taken not given. So we proceeded with something like this mindset. We took responsibility for what we could, we spoke up and contributed as much as we could.

### Rigorous Honesty

<div style="text-align:center; font-weight: 100 !important" class="quote-title"><em>Dishonesty leads to guilt, remorse and shame. Which leads us back into a state of fear. These feelings eventually burden us, consciously or more dangerously unconsciously.</em></div>

In the past we hadn't paid much attention to being thoroughly honest. We tried as best we could to be honest most of the time. At a certain point in time it was no longer possible for us to continue on this path. We found that being always honest was the only way.

When we were honest it saved us the calamity and mental stress of persisting lies, for these things always eventually got us into trouble. Now being honest all the time isn't the same as always speaking the absolute indisputable truth. We may well say something with an honest heart, that could be entirely incorrect. We may have misunderstood a situation, or mis-recalled some information the point is that honesty is what we believe to be the most constructive, most compassionate, most loving thing to do. We may not be correct or speak the truth the whole time – but this is not really the point.

An example might help illustrate this. Many years ago I travelled from a town I lived in to the city. The only route into the city was via a particular bridge. Years later a friend asks me the route I took and out of interest the timings for the bridge crossings (in those days the bridge raised and lowered to suit the passing boat traffic on the river) – was it possible for me to recall with any level of certainty the timings, not really and I couldn't give him an accurate answer. Now my friend asks me how many lanes of traffic the road could accommodate and I clearly remember there being two lanes in each direction – a total of four lanes of traffic. I could not be more certain about it. A while later after my friend had took the journey she comes to me and she says you know there were only two lanes on the bridge, one in either direction. Now clearly what I had told my friend was said in good faith, there was nothing devious or misleading about my intentions – I hadn't spoken the truth, but I had answered her questions with honesty. The questions to which I thought I didn't know the answers I had passed on and even though I was certain about the answer of the number of lanes I had been wrong. This wasn't a big deal – but hopefully illustrates the point.

Another more subtle example. I has on holiday in a foreign country and took a trip on a train. On my journey I came across some money which had been dropped, now it appeared that this money had been there for some time unnoticed. I picked up the money. Since the train was unmanned I waited until the train stopped at the next station to find the nearest attendant. I tell the platform attendant that I have found some money and that I wish to hand it in. The response given to me is that it the policy of the staff to not accept any lost and found items including money, the train was about leave, the doors close and the train departs the station – with me on it, still with the money. So then what should I do with the money? Should I put it in my pocket for myself, place it in the charity box, try and identify the owner on the train, leave the money where I found it or do something else with it? Now this is a decision that I must make. My decision may be based on a few factors – for example, the sum of money, the likelihood of finding the owner, and the individual laws and customs of the country I am visiting. Perhaps the answer is clearcut, but then again perhaps it is not. The point is that whatever decision I make should be done with the best intentions, I may make a mistake and decide to pocket the money – when in fact I should have contacted the police. The point is that if I make the decision in good faith and remaining honest then I have little to fear. So then, deciding that since the sum of money was small, and that I could not identify the owner, I put the money in my pocket with the intention of placing it in the next charity box. The next day I am at my hotel and I get a knock on the door and a policeman asks if I had found some money. The honest answer in this situation is yes, I had found some money – that is a fact. And if the police officer asks me why I did not turn it into the police station I may say that I asked an officer at the station, that the sum of money was small and I kept it with the intention of placing it in a charity box or simply that I put it in my pocket and forgot about it. The policeman may or may not be satisfied with my answer, but the point is, according to my self-conduct I have to check whether I have been honest – on reflection I may decide that actually I should have taken the money to the police station as I should have been aware of the law – were my actions at the time taken with the best intentions?

When we didn't act honestly these questions were always clearcut – we have acted deceitfully, either by telling a lie or being deceitful in our actions.

So we see then that honesty isn't about making the right decision all the time, it's perhaps more about making a decision based on the information I have available to me with the right intentions.

How did we start living our lives with complete and rigorous honesty? In order to do this we had to start with self-honesty. For if we were not honest with ourselves – something that might lead to delusion – we had little chance of being honest with others. We found that honesty was something we could practice. We were able to do this on a daily, continual basis, if we ever had a doubt that a decision we took was in good faith we would reflect upon that at the time, if possible, or at least before going to bed. If we had been dishonest or wronged somebody we promptly admitted it, making amends quickly.

We wrote down lists, completely honest lists of our shortcomings, common ones being greed, false pride, self-seeking, laziness, intolerance, denial – for these were we found all linked to a dishonest basis. Once we had identified these shortcomings we were able to seek in asking for them to be removed. Indeed through effort and continued action we were able to almost entirely eliminate these flaws. We doubted that we could ever remove all of them entirely from all situations in life, including the most testing – but this we accepted and acknowledged this was to be human. We adopted the attitude of progress, rather than perfection. For when we sought perfection and failed this would inevitably knock us back. So then by being humble but accepted our shortcomings and continued to improve ourselves – and our conduct towards others.

## 8. Taking Care of Ourselves 🔄

### Finding Balance

<span class="dropcap">W</span>e talked earlier about balance and its importance. So we turn here to a practical guide on ways which we use to achieve balance.

In no particular order we find that we should perhaps strive to nourish the triad of mind, body and soul each day. Experience shows us that to leave out one element of this triad is to neglect a significant part of our needs. Sure, it may be enough for a short period of time to get by simply taking care of one's mind, perhaps by study, or taking physical exercise. But before long however our soul will desire something more, something greater than can be achieved by feeding the mind or exercising the body. We note that the mind and the body are generally well catered for in a lot of modern cultures. It is therefore generally easier to find information that caters for exercising our intellect and physical attributes. The soul or spirit within us seems to be losing the race generally in the sense that less and less attention is paid to this part of us – throughout history this hasn't always been the case. Indeed in many cultures and societies there is a rich toolset for keeping the soul fit. In Japanese cultures there is the concept of Ikagi. Buddhism and Hinduism have Dharma. The closet concept in Western thought might be Spirituality. However we think about the part of us that makes up how we feel, drives us to ask questions and cares for the feelings of others – taking care of it is as important as going to the gym is for the body, or puzzles are for the mind. Luckily there are a number of straight forward tried and tested tools that we can employ, that have been in use by many people for thousands of years – that help us regain balance of the soul. However just as getting our bodies in shape is as straightforward as going to the gym, finding the motivation and keeping the discipline required to achieve spiritual fitness or balance is simple in theory, but not always so easy in practice.

This is why then we require daily pointers, like an exercise regime or nutritional diet. One day of focused activity will have a small impact – one day at a time, many days in a row however will have such a monumental impact so as to entirely change our lives. We may exclaim that it is impractical for anybody to achieve anything like perfect adherence to these simple principals. The simplicity is that only the next 24 hours of our lives are ever what matters, with the current moment in time being the only one we ever experience, and therefore the most important. The past is done, it can not be changed, it must be accepted, we will take care of tomorrow when tomorrow comes. So then sit and ask, what is the next right thing I must do? If you are honest in how you ask the answer will come.

### Mind, Body and Soul

#### Training the mind

#### Exercising the body

#### Nourishing the soul

### Spotting Warning Signs

Sometimes we find ourselves feeling a sense of wanting, a lack of contentment or we may say emotionally unwell – we may be lacking balance, we may have had a hard knock – so then in some cases both the feeling and the cause might be easy to identify.

There are times however where we may be so caught up in our daily business that we haven't at all stopped to notice that something is wrong. Indeed work and friendships may be going well – there is nothing to suggest that anything should be the matter with us at all. However it is our experience that the following are 'early warning signs' to some more insidious affect that may soon come about.

We familiarise ourselves with these, and are honest in our evaluations – it is not easy to admit something is off track. We imagine ourselves out of your shoes, imagine that we are an independent assessor – it is so easy to spot these things in others, but noticing them in ourselves is a life-long endeavour. Picking up on these signs has little to do with experience, in fact the older we get the more our ego may deceive us into thinking that we are perfectly joyous and loving, or at least content and satisfied. Yet we may have not dealt with a resentment which will surely soon fester and lead to anger, bitterness or hatred. Sometimes we have become over-tired, completely burned out, exhausted. And in the worst of times we had forgotten how to love altogether.

The key to identifying a cause for concern is usually honesty, we ask somebody to give us a frank opinion – asking them to humour us and see where they might pick something if they were splitting hairs. We find it is better to be cautious than to let our feelings turn to bitterness, bitterness into resentments – so that before we know it we have completed recoiled into an inward sort of self-pity or entitled arrogance.

Here then are the things we look out for:-

1. **Exhaustion** - Allowing oneself to become overly tired; usually associated with work addiction as an excuse for not facing personal frustrations.
2. **Dishonesty** - Begins with pattern of little lies; escalated to self-delusion and making excuses for not doing what's called for.
3. **Impatience** - I want what I want NOW. Others aren't doing what I think they should or living the way I know is right.
4. **Argumentative** - No point is too small or insignificant not to be debated to the point of anger and submission.
5. **Depression** - shutting ourself from the world, sitting in doors, not getting out of bed, lack of interest in taking care of oneself, letting small tasks in life slip – not taking out the trash, doing the laundry.
6. **Frustration** - Controlled anger/resentment when things don't go according to our plans. Lack of **acceptance**. See #3.
7. **Self-pity** - Feeling victimised, put-upon, used, unappreciated: convinced we are being singled out for bad luck.
8. **Cockiness** - Got it made. Know all there is to know. Can do what ever I like, I do not need to rely on others for help.
9. **Complacency** - Like #8, no longer sees value of daily housekeeping, social interaction, contact with friends and family, feels healthy, on top of the world, things are going well.
10. **Expecting too much of others** - If only that person would do as I wanted, or behaved the way I wanted. Why can't they do XYZ – it is so easy. Leads to frustration (see #6).
11. **Letting up on disciplines** - Not taking time in the day for rest, daily personal inventory, gratitude lists, not waking up and making the bed, refusing to go to sleep on time.
12. **Using mood-altering chemicals** **or pain killers** - May have a valid medical reason, but misused to help avoid the real problems.
13. **Wanting too much** - Setting unrealistic goals, placing too much value on material success, lack of appreciation of the small things in life, not enough value on personal growth.
14. **Forgetting gratitude** - Loss of sight of the abundant blessings in our everyday lives: too focused on material gain (see #13).
15. **"It can't happen to me."** - Feeling immune; forgetting what we know about our own well-being and that the vast majority of what we experience in life is ultimately out of our control.
16. **Omnipotence** - A combination of several attitudes listed above; leads to ignoring danger signs, disregarding warnings and advice from others.

Do not despair – it is natural for one or many of these things to seep into our daily lives – after all we are human, and these are common human traits. There is a solution to all of these things and the answers we have found are outlined in the following chapter _Practical daily life_.

## 9. Treating Others 🔄

### Help Others

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>The Purpose of Life is to Help Others with theirs</em></div>

<span class="dropcap">E</span>very one of us is a son or a daughter. Some of us may choose to, or not be able to have children. But each of us has something in common, we have a mother and a father.

Those of us who are fortunate enough to be parents know instinctively that our duty is to take care of our offspring. Some of us do better jobs at it than others, but for the most part we all do the best we can.

Through the ages there have been many different views on how we should treat others. The examples of "an eye for an eye", "what goes around comes around" and "treat others how you wish to be treated" come to mind – the latter being known as _The Golden Rule_, versions of which have been found in most cultures as far back as the earliest discovered writings.

Usually these ideas lead to some debate, how far should we take fair payback? How should we build moral codes and laws? Can we tell if somebody made a mistake when they caused harm – versus when the behaviour was vindictive or reckless? Another idea is that of "turning the other cheek", which lends itself to some pacifist philosophies. Can we really quash hatred with love?

Sooner or later each of us will suffer a fall from grace – often from our own making. There are very few fortunate souls who never suffer such a fall. We all lose loved ones – and we can not escape the associated dramatic, if not traumatic loss. The only way we may escape this experience perhaps would be to live alone, on a desert island say.

The human race was founded on society. Humans are not the strongest creatures – individually we are easy prey for all manner of large animals, lions, tigers, elephants, wolves, hyenas, gorillas, bears, rhinos, crocodiles – and so on. And it's not just large animals that would have us licked, snakes, scorpions, jellyfish, spiders – all kill thousands annually. Mosquitos, bacteria, Tsetse flies and viruses kill millions every year, a number that would be much higher without vaccines and medicines produced by social collaboration through science. Every day on this planet is a team effort.

So how then did we reach where we are now? Even the most narcissistic amongst us have gotten to where they are through adult guidance, parents, guardians, aunts, uncles, teachers. Life requires the help of others.

Not one of us would be where we are without the help of others. A baby can not fend for itself, it would have no food or shelter, warmth or clothes. Every single one of us has relied on the help of others.

This is not grandiose idealism – this is a fact of life. One which many of us forget at some point in our lives. Even those amongst us with the hardest hearts can not deny that life alone on this planet would be pretty dire. It is through the help and kindness of others that we are able to live our lives.

Children have a lot to teach us in this area. Watch children play – they have no bias towards gender, creed, skin colour or social status. Every child they meet is an opportunity for a friend. Children bare no grudges. Sure kids fight, but five minutes later or the next day they have moved on. Why then as adults do we become so stubborn? Why do we treat people differently bases on their social status, job title, gender, background, ethnicity? Where have we learned these prejudices? And why do we allow them to persist?

Children say what is on their mind, they say things as they see them – children often see the truth when adults are dancing around ideas of political correctness, not wanting to hurt somebody else's feelings or fear of speaking out.

Those of us who have survived the deepest traumas – life or death situations – war, terrorism, substance abuse, addiction, loss, child abuse, criminal attack, violent assault, rape – have come to experience an unparalleled togetherness . There is something in the common experience of deep injury that brings people together. Just as when the titanic is sinking it matters little if you are the captain, a decorated politician or a pantry chef in the lower decks – when you find yourself in a lifeboat, skin colour, social standing or financial wealth have very little to do with survival.

Helping others isn't a selfless act – when we help somebody we feel good about ourselves, we have a sense of pride and camaraderie that immediately improves our well-being. In fact when our survival depends on it, helping others may very well be a selfish act. The point is we found that in order to live our lives fully we must not only accept help but we must offer help to others.

==SHOW NO PREJUDICE==

### Practice before you Preach

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Before you spit out your words, be sure to taste them</em></div>

Part of what keeps us sane is sharing the ideas we find helpful in our daily lives. It was told to us that in order to keep the gifts that have come to us through practicing these principals, we must give them away. What does that really mean? Well we came to understand something like this: When we put the ideas shared with us into practice then great things come to pass. We witness this – we see people turn around their lives and overcome extreme adversity. Those who succeeded in staying on the straight and narrow path had to gives these ideas away. The most successful of us share freely these principles.

Our old ways that centred on greed, self-seeking and envy got us into much trouble. Most, if not all of us, at one time or another got into serious difficulties when we relied on our own self-will for all our guidance. It was important that we applied our own resources and abilities, but perhaps more importantly we took responsibility for our actions without assigning blame — for we have seen how destructive that can be.

We took the approach that it is better to show these principals in all our affairs than to talk about them. When we were asked or did share we found that if we hadn't practiced them and showed others what it means to live this way – it had little or no effect on ourselves or others. Indeed, throughout the ages and through our lives these words have been uttered many times, and it's not so much that they fall on deaf ears as that we sometimes lack examples as to their meaning. Left to nothing but interpretation and our minds anything was possible – healthy or unhealthy.

We have seen that all of the ideas on these pages must start with action (see _Take Action_) – for when we take action we show ourselves the meaning of these words. Let's take the idea about living our life with rigorous honesty – we may look at that and say "I know what that's about". We then put these ideas into practice, allowing our own thoughts to take root, and over time through doing them often and through experience we find a better and deeper meaning. Perhaps the first time we apply these ideas they fail, for rigorous honesty may only take root if we have balance, or if we have sufficiently cleared out our angers, fears and resentments. Many of us decided to talk to somebody with more experience and see how they apply these concepts and what we can learn from how they have applied them in their lives. For it is through continued application – trial and error – that we get a fuller understanding of what we must do.

We found that the danger of sharing these ideas with force was that we came across as insincere or that others saw us as preaching in a pompous or self-righteous way. Of course this was not our intention but when we turned the tables and put ourselves in the shoes of others we could see how this could be. How can it be that any one of us who has admitted our shortcomings, and wronged in the past, or caused damage to others, or lied or been dishonest has anything that we can say on the subjects of discipline, integrity and faith? Well then we didn't go out and preach these words, we practiced them in our daily lives, continuously – for we firstly needed them for our own well-being. We relied on these ideas to keep us sane and our thoughts sober. And by doing so we found the concepts we practiced, such as submission, rigorous honesty, compassion and respect started to become infectious. We started to see that these behaviours became contagious, for by being kind and honest to others, so others started to trust us and show us the same treatment back. In a lot of people it was not the case that this reflection happened immediately – far from it. We continued to practice our principles, and other months and years we had reached their hearts without perhaps uttering a word.

Sometimes we found that because of our new attitudes people came to us in need, they had a serious problem that they could not overcome. In some cases they saw what we had and looked at it for themselves. In other situations people were so desperate they told us they would do anything to get out of the situation they were in. We did not pounce on those who came to us and inflict our ideas. We applied our compassion, love and empathy – and sought to understand where the other was emotionally and what was their state of mind. We ensured that we looked at things from their perspective, seeking not what was needed for our gain – but trying to shine the light on what it was that they required. And by doing this and naturally showing love we were able to reach those in need. In the worst cases when people approached us for help we found that it was not only love they needed but direction – perhaps a jolt to get them to sit up see things differently. When we did this, we did so carefully with a firm kindness – and the results we found were greater than we hoped.

## 10. Twelve Steps for Life 🔄

<span class="dropcap">T</span>hese steps for life have been shamelessly and gratefully lifted from 12 step programmes. What has a programme for addiction recovery got to do with living a fulfilling life? And why not write a new set of steps?

Firstly the idea of borrowing these steps from practical programmes that treat all manner of lifelong illnesses is that they are tried and tested. We have seen them work in the most dire of circumstances – these steps save lives, prevent long-term disease and have helped millions of people rebuild their lives successfully. Medical professionals have, against the odds, and perhaps the logic of all other medical practice, been surprised by their effectiveness. Little may be understood about the exact mechanics of how they work, maybe one day this will be better understood. Nevertheless, rarely has a person who has followed the steps not been able to overcome a great problem in their life and resolve much or all of the trauma and suffering. There are many testimonies to their success, attend an open recovery meeting and you will witness for yourself how effective these principals are.

Secondly if you find yourself at one point in time coming to rely on these steps it is helpful to have somebody with more experience help you through them. This is a fundamental principal of going through these steps, it has been said that you simply can not go through them properly alone – indeed steps 4 and 8 require you to share rigorously with somebody else. One of the ideas here is to relieve yourself of the burden of guilt, shame and remorse and to give you greater courage in the face of adversity (refer to section _Guilt, Shame, Remorse_). Since many recovered addicts have been through these steps they may be ideal candidates to guide you through them. You might know somebody in your circle of friends, colleagues, associates or family who has battled with alcohol – say, or has suffered with an eating disorder. Speak to them and ask for help – if you prefer to retain anonymity seek out your local help group on the internet, your GP, social worker or local religious leader who can all also point you in the right direction. Hopefully the person you connect with will empathise with any suffering you may be in and will surely take time to work with you or point you in the right direction.

The original wordings of the steps have been changed, but the essence has remained – it is the hope that the words will be easy to understand and apply in a wide variety of situations. The original 12 steps contained the word God, it is up to you to decide what the power you rely on in steps 1-3 means to you (chapter 2. Truth, Belief and Open-mindedness might be helpful in deciding). Many people choose to use the concept of a Higher Power, which is simply a power greater than ourselves – and people think of this Higher Power as a variety of things, ranging from the Universe, the Great Outdoors, science or a group of friends and family. Whatever this power is to you, you must understand that it is a power greater than yourself, part of which you will find in yourself, and other parts of which you will find outside of you. It is the realisation that part of this power is outside of you that really matters – and the acceptance that you are connected to all things is extremely important to understand – you can not overcome extreme adversity alone.

### Acceptance

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>“Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery.”</em></div>

What is acceptance and why is it important? Can everything in life be changed?

Acceptance is taking a situation as it is, without the urge to change it. When we find acceptance we hope to find peace or a sense of ease with how things are. Sometimes acceptance is needed when things change, this could be for better or worse. Acceptance may be needed at times of loss or when something is bestowed upon us, such as privilege or power. Acceptance is tricky, and takes a lot of practice – knowing what to accept and what to continue to strive for is a life-long pursuit. Ultimately if a situation can not be changed – then acceptance is our only option. One of the simplest ways we found to practice acceptance was through meditation, breathing and focusing on the present moment.

Acceptance as much as any idea in this book is something that must be practiced. Sometimes all that was required was simply to look upon a situation or circumstance from a different perspective in order to be able to accept it. For the more complex, painful or scary situations we may have more work to do. We usually start with acknowledging and we don't always try to understand. Sometimes, if we try and comprehend why something has happened or find the reason why it is so, then we have a harder time accepting it. Sometimes things happen for no reason at all.

A friend of mine lost an eye on Halloween, she was walking in the street and a firework exploded causing irreparable damage to her eye. Trying to understand why this happened was of little help to her. Naturally she struggled with acceptance, shifting between putting blame on herself and questioning was this a punishment for something she'd done earlier in life? These questions, she feels, prolonged the agony and when she finally accepted the sight in one of her eyes had gone forever she was able to move forward. Acceptance allowed her to move on, the agony that she had caused herself with these questions finally subsided. She finally acknowledged the situation for what it was, and she could then start the healing process. She never found answers to the questions: "how could this happen?" and "why did it happen to her?" – acceptance finally allowed her to move forward. She managed to move so far forward in fact that she is now able to work with people who have lost their vision – helping them also to process this loss. She finally found a purpose to her loss in helping others.

Acceptance, we found, is a lifelong practice – at other times it can be easy to identify times when acceptance is necessary at other times we may suffer a great deal of emotional pain, struggle and frustration before we decide to accept a situation. Like with most things in this book there are few general rules to apply in all cases. We have found however that some guides may be helpful.

The past is almost certainly something we must accept. Can the past be changed? If there is no way to go back and change what has happened in the past – all the reflections, analysing and hindsight will not what has happened. The past is something we usually have to come to accept. Things that have happened in the past may well be the very place where we start our practice of acceptance.

Sometimes we may find acceptance by looking from a different point of view, or in a different light, we can try and see it from somebody else's position – and we search for this opportunity in any situation.

==The present moment is usually something we can influence, through our words and our actions. Whilst the situation we are in is usually something we have to accept, the weather, traffic and the economical market are perhaps the surest examples of things we found we need to accept – it is possible to change how we react, and perceive a given situation.

A starting point to acceptance we found is that we will need to understand that we can not control everything that happens to us. Having a greater awareness that things will happen that will not go our way helps to dampen the blow when a shock occurs. Often times we have to accept other people's feelings towards us – it may be so that over a period of time we can change our behaviours – which in turn may influence how somebody feels, but we can not, for example, force somebody to fall romantically in love with us. Indeed - we found that in situations when we did try to force a matter, this only had the opposite effect – to all but guarantee that what we were striving for did not come about because of the use of excessive control. Isn't it the case that sometimes the harder we try to hold something the further we push it away? Do not use this as an excuse for doing nothing to enact change when you can. For there are always things we can do, with practice and effort we can control our behaviours, what we say, how we act and to a large extent how we channel our thoughts

Fighting too intently against what can not be changed can be a great cause of frustration. Indeed, we have tied ourselves up in knots with when we think "if only this were the case", or "if only that were different". Ultimately sometimes things just are the way they are.

So then, once we had learned acceptance we came to understand that it wasn't something to obtain and put on a shelf. Just because we went to bed one day accepting things that have happened, did not mean that the next day we would not need to start on our process of acceptance again.

An example might help underline this. Say a close friend has passed away. There is nothing we can do that will physically bring this person back. This is a hallmark of a situation that requires acceptance. Of course there will be a healthy – if not painful process of grieving. So we do all of the things that we have found to help – we allow ourselves to proceed through the natural stages associated with coming to terms with our loss, we may for example choose to take actions that will help commemorate our loved one. Through hard work, positive honest reflection and actions we may reach a point of coming to terms with what has happened. We may be able to put our head on our pillow at night and sleep with a degree of peace. Upon awakening however, we may find that our acceptance has completely lost us - and that we must restart our process of acceptance. We remind ourselves that emotions are designed to be felt and that part of growing is feeling these things. Through continued efforts, one day we find that we wake up with a level of acceptance already within us and this is, we find, the nature of acceptance. Something that for the most difficult situations must be worked on daily, something that may get easier to hold on to the more we practice.

The final stage of acceptance is sometimes that of "letting go". Letting go is not easy and it is scary, but if we have come to peace with something and have found no other way of seeing a situation or influencing it, then letting go we have found, was – despite the initial fear – a complete revelation for us. At these times letting go has lifted us of a burden that we had held on to for a long time – it was no wonder then that this final loosening of the things that bound us did much to help set us free. Whether it be pain, anger, sorrow, jealously, shame, guilt – finally making amends for the things we did – and then letting go we found was an extremely powerful process – so liberating in fact, that once we had learned this method we scarcely could believe how we had managed without.

### Letting Go

<div style="text-align:center" class="quote-title"><em>Letting go is a process of opportunity, not of loss.</em></div>

Let go. Yes, let go.

We have said already, letting go is hard – really hard. It's scary. And for good reason. When we've held on to something for so long it becomes part of our identity. It might be a job, a favourite toy, a relationship, a guilt, a fear, a place. Isn't it true that to move forward, we have to let go? How can we move forward and hold on to something that doesn't want to, can't or won't budge? And what if something is taken from us without our choice?

Letting-go is closely related to acceptance. Usually when we let go we have to accept the change that will come and that sometimes the thing we are letting go of isn't coming back.

In order to let go we have to face our fears. We have to face the question: What will life be like without? We may have held on to something for so long we can't imagine ourselves without it. But we need to understand that an idea, a thing, a job, a person is not part of us. We never actually 'had it' in the first place. In a culture where a large part of perceptions about people gets formed by what job we have, what vehicle we drive, which house we live in, which school we attend, who we marry, who we hang around with – then it is no wonder that we fool ourselves into believing these things form part of who we are. But do they? And when we stop to think about it, it is really easy to spot. Ironically, seeing somebody else for who they are is often easier. Does the car your best friend drive define them? Aren't people capable of change? Does a job define somebody? Does a status symbol really define who a person is?

When we hold on to something that will be taken away, perhaps a friend has passed away, or we have lost or job or we are being evicted it creates frustration. We recall that fear is a projection of a future event – that hasn’t yet happened. So when we let fear overwhelm us, we are actually causing suffering to ourselves that can be avoided. The decision really isn't ours about what is taken from us and what isn't. So the choice we have to make is how we think about that. It's no surprise that _Acceptance_ is key here. When we allow acceptance into our life we have a much better chance of overcoming any trauma associated with the act of letting go.

##### Why Let Go?

There is also a beauty in letting-go. We recall the chapter _Everything comes at a price_, then the opposite is also too – if we let go of one thing, then something else comes to fill its place. When a person dies –memories blossom; when we move where we live – there are new places to explore and new friendships to make; if I lose a job, it's a chance to find new ways to apply myself. Not all things we let go of disappear from our lives – far from it. When we move out of a house, we often have the ability to return – when the dynamic of relationship ends – perhaps that of a husband and wife separating, it gives great opportunity to redefine what that relationship looks like moving forward. Letting go is a process of opportunity, not of loss.

When something is a source of grief, anguish or suffering – letting go is also about giving up that pain. I may be in a toxic relationship, I'm with somebody who is putting me down, being hurtful and contributing to low-self esteem. I have tried all I can to put this relationship on a positive footing and of well-being for all, but every action I take – even from the advice of people with relevant experience – seems to make the situation worse. So then, in this situation, won't letting go allow me to give up a source of pain and move forward?

## 11. Practical Daily Life 🔄

<span class="dropcap">M</span>ost of what is written earlier in this book is of general application. From this chapter forward this book turns to more practical affairs. Now that we have looked at questions concerning such topics as truth, submission and gratitude we may turn our attention to some more practical applications.

### Gratitude Lists

==All that we have is given to us and all that we receive we work for. If we lack gratitude we are in danger of taking something for granted. Expressing gratitude makes us feel better. Scientific study has shown that expressing gratitude leads to better well-being, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships.==

### Just for Today

Just for today I will try to live through this day only, and not tackle all my problems at once. I can do something for twelve hours that would appall me if I felt I had to keep it up for a lifetime.

Just for today I will be content with what I have.

Just for today I will adjust myself to what is, and not try to adjust everything to my own desires. I will take my “luck” as it comes, and fit myself to it.

Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind, I will study, I will learn something useful. I will not be a mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort, thought and concentration.

Just for today I will do somebody a good turn, and not get found out; if anyone knows of it, it will not count. I will do at least two things I don’t want to do – just for exercise.

Just for today I will be agreeable. I will look as well as I can, dress appropriately, keep my voice low, be courteous, criticise not one bit. I won’t fault everything, nor try to improve or regulate anybody but myself.

Just for today I will have a program. I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it. I will save myself from two pests: hurry and indecision.

Just for today I will have a quiet half hour all by myself and relax. During this half hour, sometime, I will try to get a better perspective of my life.

Just for today I will face up to my fears. I will not be afraid to notice what is beautiful and to believe that as I give to the world, so the world will give to me.

## Appendix 2: Sayings

Believe in your potential. Perhaps your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.

It does not matter how long you are spending on the earth, how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received. It is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters.

We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

The only time you fail is when you fall down and stay down.

You have to walk, and create the way by your walking; you will not find a ready-made path waiting for you.

“My heart is so small
it's almost invisible.
How can You place
such big sorrows in it?
"Look," He answered,
"your eyes are even smaller,
yet they behold the world.”

When you connect to the silence within you, that is when you can make sense of the disturbance going on around you.

Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.

You’ll be calm the day you learn to sit alone and do nothing.

The next message you need is always right where you are.

There is no difficulty that enough love will not conquer: no disease that love will not heal: no door that enough love will not open.

I close my eyes in order to see.

Grow from the inside out. None can teach, none can make you whole. There is no teacher but your own soul.

The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.

Being at ease with not knowing is crucial for answers to come to you.

This moment is all there is.

Relax into the moment and let the universe do the driving.

Nurture great thoughts, for you will never go higher than your thoughts.

Nothing is, unless our thinking makes it so.

The Way is not in the sky; the Way is in the heart.

Wake up and live.

Do anything, but let it produce joy.

The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you really are.

Enlightenment means taking full responsibility for your life.

Re-examine all you have been told. Certainty will kill.

I can not control what happens around me, but I can learn to control my reaction.

The swiftest horse can't overtake a word once spoken

If you want your dinner, don't insult the cook

If you always give, you will always have

To know the road ahead, ask those returning

Touch black paint, have black fingers

The ripest fruit falls by itself

Neither fortunes nor flowers last forever

An inch of gold can't buy an inch of time

Nurture the plant one year — ten days of blossom

Slow work — fine work

At birth we bring nothing; at death we leave with the same

Laws control a lesser person; right conduct controls a greater one

Forget the favours given; remember those received

A careful foot can step anywhere

Stare at the reward and trip over your feet

Three feet of ice are not frozen in a day

Determination tempers the sword of your character

To be heard afar, bang your gong on a hilltop

Great doubts, deep wisdom… small doubts, little wisdom

To know others, know yourself first

To have principles first have courage

The wise listens to her heart, the foolish to the mob

Animals have no prejudice against man

A tile tossed over the wall, who knows where it will smash?

No horse can wear two saddles

"I heard" is good; "I saw" is better

We can study until old age, and still not finish

A good teacher opens the door; you enter by yourself
